However, the connection between \nferroptosis and anti-tumor immunity remains incompletely understood. Our \ninvestigation demonstrates that ferroptosis inducers like RSL3 can enhance the \nefficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy by activating the STAT1 signaling pathway. \nMechanistically, RSL3 activates the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 in cancer cells \nand facilitates its degradation through chaperone-mediated autophagy mediated by \nthe KFERQ motif from residues 530 to 534. This enhances cancer cells' \nsensitivity to IFN-\u03b3, leading to increased phosphorylation and nuclear \ntranslocation of STAT1 and higher expression of major histocompatibility complex \nclass I (MHC I). Consequently, this heightened sensitivity correlates with \nincreased susceptibility to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In vivo studies showed \nthat RSL3 treatment reduced SHP2 expression within tumor tissues and bolstered \nanti-tumor immunotherapy by promoting increased T cell infiltration and \nfunction. The combination of RSL3 and anti-PD-1 antibody demonstrates superior \ntherapeutic efficacy in controlling tumor growth compared to monotherapy. Our \nstudy not only elucidates a previously unrecognized link between ferroptosis and \nanti-tumor immunity but also presents a rationale for combining ferroptosis \ninducers with immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer treatment.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 The Authors.

It is crucial to explore the evolutionary pattern of chronic \ndisease comorbidity in Chinese middle-aged and elderly people and to reveal the \ndevelopmental trajectory of chronic diseases in this population.\nMETHODS: Data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS \n2015-2020) were utilized for the fixed cohort analysis. Based on the prevalence \ninformation of 14 chronic diseases (including hypertension, dyslipidemia, \ndiabetes, cancer, chronic lung diseases, liver disease, heart disease, stroke, \nkidney disease, stomach diseases, emotional problems, memory-related diseases, \narthritis, and asthma) among 10,089 participants aged \u226545 years, association \nrules and cluster analysis were used to identify trends and trajectories of \ncomorbidities in the middle-aged and elderly populations in China.\nRESULTS: The analysis revealed that the comorbidity rate of the 14 chronic \ndiseases showed a consistent annual increase from 2015-2020. By 2020, over 85% \nof patients diagnosed with a single chronic condition exhibited concurrent \nmultimorbidity. This epidemiological progression was paralleled by a progressive \nincrease in detected disease associations: binary comorbidities rose from three \nsignificant associations in 2015-10 in 2020, whereas higher-order combinations \nexpanded from one ternary association in 2015-35 ternary and 18 quaternary \nassociations by 2020. Notably, hypertension maintained a central position across \nall identified comorbidity clusters. The comorbidity patterns identified in 2015 \nincluded respiratory, liver and kidney, and cardio-cerebral comorbidity patterns \nand cancer and emotional problems. The comorbidity patterns identified in 2018 \nincluded respiratory, liver and kidney, cerebrovascular, and cardiovascular \nmetabolic comorbidity patterns. The comorbidity pattern in 2020 was the same as \nthat in 2018.\nCONCLUSION: The issues of comorbidities in chronic diseases among Chinese \nmiddle-aged and elderly people is significant, with observed variations in the \ncomorbidity patterns across different time periods. The development of clinical \nassessment and management guidelines for chronic diseases comorbid with key \nconditions, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, is recommended.

The incidence of \nPMBTs varies by geographical location. In our African context, osteosarcoma is \nthe most common PMBT seen; however, there is a variable representation of other \nPMBTs, likely due to some risk factor in the involved environment. PMBTs have \nnot been studied concerning their geographical location and the role the \nenvironment can play as a risk factor. Our study aimed to retrospectively review \nchildren and adults treated for PMBTs at our center between 2016 and 2021. \nMATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a records review of patients treated for \nprimary malignant bone tumors over 5 years.

RESULTS A total of 123 patients' records were retrieved; 91% were \nAfrican, and 58.5% were female. The mean age for our cohort was 35.38 years. \nOsteosarcoma was the most common PMBT, followed by multiple myeloma and \nchondrosarcoma, in that order. Most of our patients with PMBTs reported pain as \ntheir main symptom at presentation. The overall chemosensitivity rate was at a \nlow of 33%, due to poor compliance, while Ewing sarcoma was the most \nchemosensitive tumor in our cohort.

Understanding these differences is \nessential to optimizing patient-centered care in non-small cell lung cancer \nparticulary with the addition of new therapies in the early-stage space. This \nsystematic review evaluates sex-related disparities in HRQoL following pulmonary \nresection for lung cancer.\nMETHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, \nusing Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases selecting publications \nfrom January 2014 to June 2024. Eligible studies reported HRQoL outcomes with \nsex-disaggregated data in patients undergoing pulmonary resection for lung \ncancer. The risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias 1 (RoBINS-1) tool, \nand data were synthesized qualitatively.\nRESULTS: Among 9,861 studies screened, 66 full-text articles were reviewed, and \n11 met inclusion criteria. HRQoL tools included: Short-Form 36 (SF-36; 20%), \nEuropean Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life \nQuestionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30; 20%), Short-Form 12 (20%), and the Visual \nAnalog Scale (VAS; 30%).

Studies with \noverlapping populations were excluded. Statistical analyses employed a \nrandom-effects model, with heterogeneity assessed via I2 statistics. This study \nwas registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024553421).\nRESULTS: Eight observational studies (2,394 patients) met inclusion criteria. No \neligible RCTs were identified. Median follow-up ranged from 10-53\u2009months. D\u2009+\u2009T \nimproved RFS compared to anti-PD(L)1 therapies (HR 0.53, 95%CI 0.40-0.70, \np\u2009<\u20090.01; I2=55%).

In addition, assessment of immunization status and screening \nfor intimate partner violence and sexual coercion, as well as screening for \nhuman papillomavirus and cervical cancer, are unanimously recommended. All \nmedical societies also agree that counseling on diet, body mass index, and \nphysical activity should be routinely offered along with a review of supplements \nand advice on folic acid supplementation. Furthermore, the need of medication \nreview for potential teratogenic effects and the importance of assessing for \nenvironmental and occupational exposure to teratogens are underlined by all \nguidelines. Moreover, ACOG and PHAC recommend a discussion regarding \ncontraception, support an optimal interpregnancy interval of at least 18 months, \nand underline that screening for sexually transmitted infections should be \noffered only in cases with existing risk factors. ACOG and RANZCOG also suggest \nthat patients should be offered guidance on proper food handling and traveling \nrestrictions to prevent certain infectious diseases. Finally, ACOG and PHAC \nprovide guidance on the preconception management of chronic medical conditions, \nwhereas RANZCOG, although mentioning that all preexisting medical conditions \nshould be optimized before achieving pregnancy, provides no further guidance.\nCONCLUSION: Preparing for a healthy pregnancy not only drives favorable \nperinatal outcomes, but is also associated with long-lasting benefits for the \noffspring.

The \nremaining 2 patients had isolated myeloid sarcoma with normal marrow without a \nhistory of hematologic disorder. Twenty-nine patients had bone tumors only, 3 \nmuscle tumors only, 8 both bone and soft tissue tumors, and 1 intraarticular \nsynovial tumor of an ankle. Of the 71 focal bone tumors, 68 were lytic and 3 \nwere sclerotic. In addition, diffuse sclerotic bone lesions were present in 1 \npatient, and diffuse mixed lytic/sclerotic bone lesions in 2 patients. Most \ntumors were asymptomatic and were discovered incidentally on imaging. Local \npain, mass, and pathologic fractures were the most common complaints when \npresent.

The key target may be either the mutated/fused protein itself \nor a protein whose expression is directly dysregulated and involved in \nproliferation, resistance to cell death, or other cellular processes associated \nwith the oncogenic process. Identifying the best therapeutic strategy requires \nevaluating both inhibitors of the altered protein and the dysregulated oncogene \nlinked to the pathology. Within this context, the MLL-rearranged subtype (MLL-r) \nof acute myeloid leukemia (AML) poses significant challenges due to unfavorable \nprognosis, frequent relapses, and treatment resistance. MLL-r AMLs are known to \nbe addicted to the oncogene transcription factor HOXA9, with a differentiation \nblockade that relies on its ability to bind DNA. Recently, several MLL-r \nepigenetic complex inhibitors have been developed, some entering clinical \ntrials.

The aim of this study is to investigate to what extent this \nassociation holds for the patient cohorts of our clinic who underwent elective \nintracranial surgery and whether in our experience early extubation (EE) was \ninferior to delayed extubation (DE).\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2018 and 2020, 190 patients were surgically \ntreated for BM in the authors' neurosurgery department. Early extubation was \ndefined as extubation immediately after surgery in the recovery room. The DE \ngroup was electively extubated after surgery in the intensive care unit. We \nanalyzed demographic data, ASA status, blood loss, comorbidities, duration of \nsurgery, blood transfusion, length of hospital stay, surgical-related \ncomplications and adverse events.\nRESULTS: A total of 65 patients (34.2%) were extubated early. In the remaining \n65.8% of patients extubation was delayed. In the univariate analysis, no \nstatistical significance was found between the two groups, particularly with \nregard to complications. The only relevant difference was in the DE group, who \nhad greater transfusion requirements (p\u2009=\u20090.037). The DE group showed more AE, \nbut this was not significant in the multivariate analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that early extubation was justifiable and safe \nfor our patients.

Electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) \nmonitoring and follow-up of symptoms has improved suffering, but limited work \nhas explored combined subjective and objective measures. This secondary analysis \nexplored the relationship between oncology symptoms and step count using the \nSymptom Care at Home (SCH) digital monitoring platform.\nMETHODS: Participants reported 11 disease and treatment symptoms: fatigue, \ntrouble sleeping, nausea and vomiting, pain, numbness or tingling, depressed \nmood, feeling nervous or anxious, trouble breathing, diarrhea, sore mouth, and \ntrouble thinking or concentrating via ePRO and independently reported step count \nvia Garmin activity monitors. Analysis included descriptive statistics and \nlinear mixed-effect models to examine the relationship between symptom burden \nand step count.\nRESULTS: Of participants who provided Garmin activity monitors (n\u2009=\u2009339), 18-5 \n(54%) reported ePRO symptoms and step counts. A mean 76.56\u00a0days of step count \nand 56\u00a0days of ePRO were reported. The mean step count was 3164.34 \n(SD\u2009=\u20092370.28). Using a scale of 0-10, our results indicate that a 1-point \nincrease in total symptom severity burden is associated with a decrease of \napproximately 46 daily steps (B\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u200945.94, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Individual symptom \nanalysis found that a one-point symptom increase corresponded with a 165-step \ncount decrease with a one-point increase in fatigue (B\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u2009165.33, p\u2009<\u20090.001), \na 107-step decrease with increased nausea and vomiting (B\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u2009107.49, \np\u2009<\u20090.001), and a 28-step reduction in pain.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a relationship between ePRO and step count \nin patients undergoing systemic cancer treatment across diagnoses. Notably, \nfatigue was the most prevalent symptom impacting activity, even more prevalent \nthan nausea, vomiting, and pain.

Prostate adenocarcinoma has \na non-immunogenic profile and can respond to temporizing non-chemotherapeutic \ntreatments such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We examine two cases of \nlung transplantation (LT) in patients with high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) \ndiagnosed during pretransplant evaluation, in whom transplantation was \nprioritized before definitive cancer treatment.\nMETHODS: Single-center retrospective review of patients with end-stage organ \ndysfunction who underwent solid organ transplant between January 2018 and \nOctober 2023 after being diagnosed with high-risk PCa and before definitive \noncologic treatment.\nRESULTS: Two patients met inclusion criteria. One had end-stage interstitial \nlung disease and the other had post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis; both had WHO \ngroup III pulmonary hypertension and underwent expedited LT after being \ndiagnosed with high-risk PCa on pretransplant malignancy screening. One patient \nwas treated with ADT pre-transplant and definitive external beam radiotherapy \npost-transplant. The second patient has not received definitive therapy for his \nPCa. Both remain alive with ongoing management of their clinically localized \ncancer at 24 and 10\u00a0months post-transplant, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: In experienced transplant centers, it is reasonable to prioritize \nlifesaving transplantation for patients with newly diagnosed, localized \nhigh-risk PCa.

Studies addressing this topic are very \nscarce and the underlying mechanisms supporting this association remain \nincompletely understood. Here, we investigated the effects of ICU acuity \n(defined as the mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 of all admitted \npatients in the bimester in which a given patient was admitted) and \norganizational factors on the outcomes of patients with a low risk of dying \nadmitted to ICUs.\nDESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.\nSETTING: One hundred and thirty-four ICUs from Brazil and Uruguay.\nPATIENTS: All low-risk (defined as a Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 \nprobability of death < 3%) patients admitted between 2016 and 2018.\nINTERVENTIONS: None.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was hospital mortality; \nsecondary outcomes were ICU mortality, and ICU and hospital lengths of stay \n(LOS). ICU acuity was evaluated as a continuous variable. Multilevel \nmultivariable regression analyses were used to explore the association between \nICU acuity, organizational characteristics, and outcomes. Of 285,553 patients, \n69,675 (24.4%) were considered low risk. Elective surgeries (66.2%) were the \nmain admission reason. In the models adjusted for patient- and ICU-level \ncharacteristics, ICU acuity was not associated with hospital mortality (odds \nratio [OR] = 1.095 [0.942-1.274]) and all secondary outcomes. These results were \nconsistent in sensitivity analyses. The presence of dedicated pharmacists in the \nICU (OR = 0.531 [0.365-0.773]) and the number of implemented clinical protocols \n(OR = 0.817 [0.688-0.970]) were independently associated with lower hospital \nmortality. Clinical protocols were also associated with shorter ICU and hospital \nLOS.\nCONCLUSIONS: ICU acuity was not associated with outcomes in low-risk patients. \nAppropriate multidisciplinary staffing coupled with adherence to best clinical \npractices are essential to optimize efficiency and minimize variability of care \nfor this population.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer \nHealth, Inc.

Here, a self-triggering proteolysis RNA interference system \n(cRGD-VFs) is elaborately constructed to precisely disturb mitochondrial iron \nhomeostasis, the core hub of cellular iron regulation, for evoking antitumor \nimmunity. Specifically, ferritin is conjugated with E3 ligase ligand VH032 and \ntumor-targeting cRGD peptide through click chemistry, and further loaded with \nENO1-targeted siRNA to prepare cRGD-VFs. Following the targeted uptake by tumor \ncells, cRGD-VFs recruits E3 ligase to initiate the ubiquitination process to \ntrigger the proteolysis of ferritin, resulting in the release of abundant Fe2+ \nand the loaded siRNA. siRNA-mediated ENO1-targeted knockdown would upregulate \nthe mitochondrial iron transport channel through the ENO1-IRP1-Mfrn1 pathway, \nwhich subsequently leads to mitochondrial iron overload and the increase of \ndetrimental mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby triggering \nsevere mitochondria destruction and causing mass death of tumor cells. \nNoteworthily, it is found that cRGD-VFs-mediated mitochondrial iron overload can \nactivate powerful antitumor immunity by upregulating immune-related pathways to \neliminate tumors, achieving notable tumor suppression in multiple murine liver \ncancer models, which represents a promising strategy of disturbing mitochondrial \niron homeostasis for potentiating antitumor immunotherapy.", "\u00a9 2025 Wiley\u2010VCH GmbH.", "DOI: 10.1002/adma.202508457\nPMID: 40757917", "\n11.

The \nSocial Cognitive Theory and Social Context Framework informed development of the \ninterview and focus group moderator guides. We used deductive and inductive \napproach to code transcripts and thematic analysis to generate themes.\nFINDINGS: Barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake were misconceptions about COVID-19 \nvaccines shaped by misinformation, politicization of vaccines, historical trauma \nand mistrust in government, and structural barriers in rural agricultural \ncommunities. Having access to accurate and understandable COVID-19 vaccine \ninformation and receiving information from trusted sources were motivators of \nCOVID-19 vaccine uptake. Protecting families, children, elders, and the \ncommunity, and striving to return to normal life were also noted as motivators.\nCONCLUSIONS: Understanding the community's perceptions and experiences around \nthe COVID-19 vaccine is critical for successful implementation of strategies to \nincrease vaccine uptake during future public health emergencies.

However, the underlying \nmolecular mechanisms whereby Dexmedetomidine exerts its anticancer and \nchemopreventive actions need to be elucidated. In this study, we found that \nDexmedetomidine reduced cell viability of the lung cancer cell line A549 cells \nin a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, Dexmedetomidine reduced the telomerase \nactivity in A549 cells by reducing the gene levels of hTERT but increasing the \ngene levels of TERF2. The senescence- associated-\u03b2- galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) \nstaining assay demonstrates that Dexmedetomidine stimulated cellular senescence \nby activating the p53/p16 signaling. Additionally, treatment with \nDexmedetomidine led to increased ROS production and the expression of \u03b3H2AX, \nimplicating typical DNA damage in lung cancer cells. Interestingly, \nDexmedetomidine increased the expression of NOX5 but not NOX1 or NOX2. Knockdown \nof NOX5 abolished the effects of Dexmedetomidine in telomerase activity, gene \nexpression of hTERT and TERF2, the p53/p16 signaling, as well as cellular \nsenescence, suggesting that the effects of Dexmedetomidine are mediated by NOX5. \nIn summary, these findings show that Dexmedetomidine blunts the growth of lung \ncancer cells by inducing premature senescence via ROS-mediated DNA damage.", "\u00a9 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.", "DOI: 10.1002/jbt.70414\nPMID: 40757447 [Indexed for MEDLINE]", "\n26.

However, a notable subset of patients exhibits resistance to VEN/DEC, \ndemonstrating either no disease response or relapse after initial remission. \nThis study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this \nresistance through analyses of gene expression and DNA methylation profiles. We \nconducted comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis and DNA methylation profiling on \nAML samples from 35 patients undergoing VEN/DEC therapy. The RNA sequencing \nanalysis revealed that several genes related to fatty acid metabolism were \nsignificantly upregulated in leukemia cells from patients who received VEN/DEC \ntreatment and relapsed or failed to respond. Increased expression of peroxisome \nproliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) occurred after treatment and \ncorrelated with decitabine-induced promoter hypomethylation. Subsequent in vitro \nvalidation demonstrated that decitabine treatment results in hypomethylation of \nthe PPARG promoter, elevating PPARG levels and promoting a metabolic environment \ncharacterized by enhanced fatty acid oxidation pathways conducive to VEN/DEC \nresistance. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition using either a PPAR\u03b3 \nantagonist or a fatty acid oxidation inhibitor enhanced the sensitivity of \nresistant cells to VEN/DEC, underscoring the crucial role of PPAR\u03b3 in the \ndevelopment of therapeutic resistance. These findings not only shed light on the \nmetabolic adaptation that contributes to VEN/DEC resistance in AML but also \nidentify PPAR\u03b3 as a potential therapeutic target for overcoming such resistance, \nproviding new opportunities to improve the efficacy of VEN/DEC-based therapy in \nAML.", "\u00a9 2025 American Society of Hematology.

This syndrome is particularly relevant in the context of \nimmunotherapy, where immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as atezolizumab \nare increasingly used in the treatment of advanced cancers. While atezolizumab \nis generally well-tolerated, immune-related adverse events, including \ncardiovascular toxicity, have been reported. Understanding the potential for \nICIs to induce severe complications like KS is essential for ensuring patient \nsafety and effective management.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A smoker in their 70s with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma \nexperienced an anaphylactic reaction during the second cycle of atezolizumab. \nThe reaction was accompanied by chest tightness and elevated troponin T levels. \nEchocardiographic evaluation revealed severe dilatation of the left ventricular \napex and a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Coronary \nangiography excluded significant coronary stenosis but confirmed apical \nballooning, consistent with the type I variant of KS. This diagnosis underscores \nthe potential for immune-related cardiovascular events associated with ICIs to \nmimic acute coronary syndromes, challenging clinicians to distinguish between \nimmune-mediated effects and primary cardiac conditions.\nCONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of recognizing KS as a \npotential differential diagnosis in patients undergoing immunotherapy who \npresent with acute coronary symptoms. The findings suggest that atezolizumab may \ntrigger severe immune-related cardiovascular toxicity, emphasizing the need for \nvigilance among clinicians.

Ruthenium-(II) \nphotosensitizers (Ru-(PS)) are of interest due to their rich photochemical \nproperties and potential antibacterial and anticancer activities reported in \nprevious studies. However, the low uptake by bacterial and cancer cells has \nlimited the clinical uses of Ru-(PS). In this study, the potential of \nmembrane-targeting peptides involving arginine-tryptophan (Arg-Trp or RW) in \nenhancing the uptake of the Ru-(PS), namely, RuCOOH, into bacterial and cancer \ncells, as well as their antibacterial and anticancer efficiencies, has been \nstudied. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of compounds against eight \nbacteria, including (SA), (AB), (PA), and (EC), both susceptible (S) and \nresistant (R) strains, were determined using the broth microdilution method. \nAnticancer activities (IC50) of the compounds against breast cancer cell lines \n(MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468) were studied using the MTT assay. The \ncellular uptake of the compounds into bacterial and cancer cells was also \nstudied via confocal and fluorescence imaging. Noncancerous cells MRC-5 and \nMCF-10A were used to compare the selectivity of the compounds to bacterial or \ncancer cells. RuCOOH alone demonstrated MIC values of >128 \u03bcM against all eight \nbacteria, whereas its Arg-Trp conjugates showed lower MIC values (2-32 \u03bcM) \nagainst all bacteria except PA-(R) and AB-(S). A significant 4-fold reduction in \nMIC values (from >128 to 2-32 \u03bcM) was observed when the conjugates were tested \nagainst EC-(S) and AB-(R) compared to RuCOOH alone. For anticancer activities, \nRuCOOH alone demonstrated IC50 values of >100 \u03bcM, whereas its Arg-Trp conjugates \n(RuRW6, RuRW8, and RuRW9) showed lower IC50 values (5.44-93.08 \u03bcM) against all \nthree breast cancer cell lines. Cellular uptake studies demonstrated the \nassociations of RuRW9 with bacteria and breast cancer cells, whereby a red color \nsignal was observed in the areas presented with cells when compared to the \ncontrol and RuCOOH alone.

Transfer Learning (TL) addresses this challenge by \nleveraging the information of other patients with the same disease (i.e., the \nsource domain) when building a personalized model for each patient (i.e., the \ntarget domain).

Their treatment depends on imaging features (size, number, location) \nand their genetic mutation subtype, small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non-small \ncell lung cancer (NSCLC). In patients with SCLC, prophylactic whole-brain \nradiotherapy (WBRT) with hippocampal sparing (HS) is recommended, whereas in \npatients with NSCLC, systemic targeted therapy is preferred.

These included the \nrat aortic ring assay, endothelial tube formation assay, cell invasion assay \nusing endothelial cell lines (Ea.hy926), and a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture \nspheroid model to simulate tumor microenvironment behavior. Comparisons were \nmade with known inhibitors: quercetin (15.11 \u03bcg/mL) and suramin (100 \u03bcg/mL).\nRESULTS: MO-AgNPs at 12 \u03bcg/mL significantly inhibited Ea.hy926 cell invasion by \n62.10% and significantly suppressed endothelial tube formation, comparable to \nthe effect of quercetin. In the ex vivo aortic ring assay, MO-AgNPs reduced \nmicrovessel sprouting by 83.824 \u00b1 0.081%, surpassing the inhibition achieved by \nsuramin. Additionally, in the 3D spheroid model, MO-AgNPs at concentrations of \n12 \u03bcg/mL and 6 \u03bcg/mL, as well as quercetin, significantly reduced spheroid \ndiameter by day 14, indicating suppressed invasive potential and angiogenic \nsupport.\nCONCLUSIONS: MO-AgNPs exhibit strong anti-angiogenic and anti-invasive effects \nacross various tumor-relevant models, highlighting their potential as a \ntherapeutic agent against tumor progression and angiogenesis-related diseases. \nThese results support further investigation of MO-AgNPs as a novel \nnanotherapeutic for cancer treatment.", "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.", "DOI: 10.37349/etat.2025.1002332\nPMCID: PMC12314757\nPMID: 40757059", "Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflicts \nof interest.", "\n8.

It is severe, \npersistent, and imposes a significant financial burden on the healthcare system. \nGiven FCR's profound impact on mental health and quality of life, adopting \ntargeted interventions to mitigate its effects is essential. This study reports \non the efficacy of MindOnLine, an online mindfulness program, for people living \nwith-and beyond-breast, prostate or colorectal cancer, in reducing FCR, anxiety \nand depression.\nMETHODS: Randomized controlled trial (1:1) comparing MindOnline with a waitlist \ngroup (ANZCTR: 12620000645954). Eligibility criteria: \u226518 years, living in \nAustralia, completed active treatment/surveillance for stages 1-3 breast, \nprostate or CRC, within the last 5 years, had internet access, and a Fear of \nCancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI) severity score \u226513. MindOnLine was a \nself-directed, brief, online 9-week program, with a new module unlocked each \nweek. The intervention incorporated education, mindfulness practices, and \nmeditation, to promote awareness and emotion regulation. Data were captured at \nbaseline, 9-weeks and 9-months post-randomization. Linear mixed models assessed \nMindOnLine's impact on the primary (FCRI total score) and secondary (anxiety \n(GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9)) outcomes.\nFINDINGS: Between October 2020 and June 2023, 434 participants randomized, of \nwhich 58% had breast, 26% prostate and 16% colorectal cancer; 70% were female; \n50% were aged \u226560 years; and 67.5% resided in metropolitan areas. At 9-weeks, \nMindOnLine decreased the FCRI total score (-5.61, 95% CI [-8.61, -2.61], p < \n0.001); anxiety (-1.29 [-2.15, -0.43], p = 0.003) and depression (-1.47 [-2.34, \n-0.61], p < 0.001) scores, compared to the waitlist group. Intervention effects \nwere sustained at 9-months (FCRI: -5.06 [-8.61, -1.52]; p = 0.005; anxiety: \n-1.22 [-2.21, -0.24], p = 0.015; depression: -1.09 [-2.03, -0.16], p = 0.022).\nINTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate that a self-directed, brief, online \nmindfulness-based program mitigates moderate or severe fear of cancer \nrecurrence.

The proportion of BC patients with hormone \nreceptor-positive (HR+)/HER2- are more likely to metastasize to bone. The phase \n3 Destiny-Breast04 study led to the approval of the antibody drug conjugate \ntrastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in HER2-low patients, even HR+, after lines of \nendocrine therapy and one line of chemotherapy. Recently, the Destiny-Breast06 \nstudy showed a progression-free survival advantage of T-DXd also in first-line. \nT-DXd has an immunological effect as it can produce antibody-dependent cellular \ncytotoxicity-like effects by recruiting dendritic cells and CD8+ T cells. This \nimmunological effect can be enhanced using immune checkpoint inhibitors but also \nthe anti-RANK-ligand (RANKL) antibody denosumab, which can be used for the \nprevention of skeletal-related events (SREs). RANK modulates HER2-driven \ncarcinogenesis because both RANK and HER2 activate nuclear factor \nkappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB). Thus, increased RANK \nsignaling may contribute to the development of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy \nthrough NF-\u03baB activation. It remains to be seen whether patients with \nHER2-positive or HER2-low BC that express RANK may benefit from concomitant HER2 \nand RANK inhibition therapy. Except for the Destiny-Breast06 study, which \nincluded only 3% of enrolled patients with exclusive bone metastases, we have no \nclinical data on the efficacy of T-DXd in bone metastases and on the concomitant \nuse of T-DXd and denosumab, although the biological rationale for the increased \nefficacy of the combination is strong.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 AME Publishing Company.

Lipid metabolism \nplays a crucial role in determining the vulnerability of cells to ferroptosis, \nparticularly in cancer cells. The biosynthesis and remodeling of polyunsaturated \nfatty acid-phosphatidylethanolamine in cell membranes rely heavily on the \nactivity of acyl-CoA synthetase family member 4 (ACSL4). However, the regulatory \nmechanisms governing ACSL4 expression in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remain \nunclear. In this study, we screened a library of 765 epigenetic compounds to \nidentify novel regulators of ferroptosis. Notably, we discovered that protein \narginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) inhibitors markedly promote ferroptosis in \nRCC cells. Inhibition or knockdown of PRMT5 in RCC cell lines enhanced lipid \nperoxidation and reduced cell viability. PRMT5 interacted with and catalyzed the \nsymmetric dimethylation of ACSL4 at the arginine 549 (R549) site, facilitating \nits degradation via the proteasome. In\u00a0vivo, the combination of a PRMT5 \ninhibitor with anti-PD-1 therapy notably increased ferroptosis and reduced tumor \ngrowth. Furthermore, elevated PRMT5 levels were associated with unfavorable \nclinical outcomes in patients with renal cancer.

Ribosome profiling and proteogenomics transformed our \nunderstanding of these sequences by showing that thousands are actively \ntranslated, and hundreds produce detectable peptides by mass spectrometry. \nHowever, the random arrangement of codons across the 3-gigabase human genome \nnaturally generates smORFs by chance, suggesting many may represent \ntranslational noise or regulatory elements rather than functional proteins. This \nis supported by the fact that most translating smORFs occur in upstream open \nreading frames (uORFs), which typically regulate translation of canonical coding \nsequences rather than encode bioactive microproteins. As interest grows in \nuncovering biologically meaningful microproteins, a key challenge remains: \ndistinguishing functional smORFs from non-functional or regulatory translation \nproducts. Although empirical methods such as individual microprotein studies or \nlarge-scale screens can help, these approaches are time-consuming, expensive, \nand come with technical limitations. New complementary strategies are needed.\nMETHODS: To address this challenge, we developed ShortStop, a computational \nframework based on the idea that not all translating smORFs produce functional \nproteins, but the ones that do may resemble experimentally characterized \nmicroproteins. ShortStop classifies smORFs into two reference groups: Swiss-Prot \nAnalog Microproteins (SAMs), which resemble known microproteins, and PRISMs \n(Physicochemically Resembling In Silico Microproteins), which are synthetic \nsequences designed to match the composition of translating smORFs but lacking \nsequence order or evolutionary selection, and therefore serving as a proxy for \nnon-functional peptides. This two-class system enables machine learning to help \nprioritize smORFs for downstream study.\nRESULTS: ShortStop achieved high precision (90-94%), recall (87-96%), and F1 \nscores (90-93%) across all classes. When applied to a published dataset of \ntranslating smORFs, ShortStop classified about 8% as candidates with biochemical \nproperties resembling Swiss-Prot microproteins (i.e., called SAMs). The \nremaining 92% resembled in silico generated sequences (i.e., called PRISMs), \nrepresenting noncanonical proteins, non-functional peptides, or regulatory \ntranslation events. SAMs showed lower C-terminal hydrophobicity-linked to \nreduced proteasomal degradation-and greater N-terminal hydrophilicity at neutral \npH, suggesting improved solubility and intracellular stability. ShortStop also \nidentified microproteins overlooked by other methods, including one encoded by \nan upstream overlapping smORF in the StAR gene, which was detectable in human \ncells and steroid-producing tissues. In a clinical lung cancer dataset, \nShortStop uncovered differentially expressed microprotein candidates, several of \nwhich were validated by mass spectrometry.\nDISCUSSION: ShortStop addresses a key gap in microprotein research-the lack of \nscalable tools to characterize microproteins and standardized negative training \ndata to train machine learning models for microproteins. By providing a \nclassification framework rooted in biochemical features, ShortStop offers a \npractical solution for targeting smORFs in functional studies, benchmarking new \ndiscovery tools, and advancing microprotein research.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material \navailable at 10.1186/s44330-025-00037-4.", "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.", "DOI: 10.1186/s44330-025-00037-4\nPMCID: PMC12313729\nPMID: 40756675", "Conflict of interest statement: Competing interestsB.M., E.V., and A.S. have \nfiled a patent related to ShortStop.

It was observed that Cap has \nan antitumoral activity in several cancer types, in particular in liver, colon \nand breast cancer. Actually, the use of Cap in the cancer therapy is limited by \nits very low bioavailability, a short half-life and side effects as mouth and \nstomach irritations and burning sensation. To overcome these limitations, the \nCap has been encapsulated in carriers in order to reduce the adverse effect and \nto help the delivery in the cancer cells. In this study, we synthesized \nPoly(lactic co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) to encapsulate Cap \n(PLGA-Cap), optimizing the synthetic strategy and improving its efficiency and \nsafety. This is the first time that PLGA-Cap NPs was tested on HepG2 cells line \nfor Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy.\nMETHODS: NPs are characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Fourier \ntransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Morphological analysis by scanning \ntransmission electron microscopy (STEM) and Reverse-Phase High Liquid \nChromatography (RP-HPLC) to study their physicochemical properties and the best \ncondition in terms of size, PDI and encapsulation efficiency. In vitro \nbiological MTT assay was performed on HepG2 cells to observe the cell \nproliferation in response to PLGA-Cap. The apoptosis induced by Cap was \nevaluated the enzymatic activity of caspase 3, Bcl2 and Bax expression by \nWestern blot and ROS activity.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our preparation showed the highest Encapsulation \nEfficiency (96%) reported by the literature, showing an improvement of 21% \ncompared to what is actually reported. In vitro experiments revealed that \nPLGA-Cap formulation induced similar biological effects in terms of cell \nviability compared to free Cap. Moreover, HepG2 cancer cells treated with \nPLGA-Cap exhibited increased caspase 3 activity respect to those treated with \nfree Cap.\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion we demonstrated that our preparation showed an \nimprovement in encapsulation parameters and in pro-apoptotic and anticancer \nactivity in HepG2 cells.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 Mul\u00e8, Caputo, Montefusco, Romanelli, Caputo, Paolella, Aliberti \nand Cusano.", "DOI: 10.3389/fbioe.2025.1617022\nPMCID: PMC12313566\nPMID: 40756642", "Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.", "\n41.

The \nsuccess of these vaccines has brought mRNA technology to the forefront of \nefforts to develop novel vaccines. However, as this is a rapidly evolving field, \nthere is a need for a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the current \nevidence base to guide further research and development. This study, therefore, \nsystematically reviewed the literature on clinical trials using mRNA vaccines \nfor infectious diseases other than COVID-19.\nMETHODS: A systematic review of the literature, following the PRISMA 2020 \nguidelines, identified clinical trials in infectious diseases other than \nCOVID-19. PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov were screened for such clinical trials \nusing search terms related to mRNA vaccines, and the results of the two \nindependent searches were combined. Clinical trials using mRNA vaccines against \neither COVID-19 or non-communicable diseases were removed, as were duplicated \nstudies. The remaining clinical trials were then stratified based on pathogen, \nstatus, and phase.\nRESULTS: Nine hundred and seventy-six clinical trials were identified, of which \n83 met the inclusion criteria. These included candidate mRNA vaccines against 14 \nviral, two bacterial and one protozoan infection.

Photoresponsive hydrogels have great potential for integrated \npostsurgical treatment of melanoma by embedding photosensitizers or photothermal \nagents in porous polymer networks, combining the advantages of hydrogels and \nphototherapy technologies. Methods: The photoresponsive PCCUR hydrogel was \nsynthesized via a thermal induction method, incorporating polydopamine \nnanoparticles (PDA-NPs), Chlorella extract (CE), and curdlan (CUR). The \nphysicochemical properties of PCCUR and its effects on skin cells and B16F10 \ncells were systematically evaluated through in vitro experiments. The antitumor \nrecurrence efficacy of the PCCUR hydrogel was assessed via an incomplete \nmelanoma resection model. Furthermore, the regulatory effects of PCCUR on \ninfected wound healing and its inhibitory effects on hypertrophic scar formation \nwere investigated under temporally controlled laser irradiation. Results: The \nphotoresponsive PCCUR hydrogel possesses temperature sensitivity, injectable \nproperties, optimal mechanical strength, and significant antimicrobial activity \nand is tailored to mitigate postsurgical issues through healing phase-specific \nlaser irradiation adjustments. During the inflammatory phase, synergistic \nphotodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) not only eliminate \ninfections but also induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), releasing tumor \nantigens that bypass tumor heterogeneity and are captured by the in situ \nhydrogel. The antigen-captured hydrogel acts as an \"antigen reservoir\" and \nreleases captured antigens to recruit dendritic cells (DCs) to stimulate an \nantitumor immune response. In the proliferation phase, the inherent properties \nof the hydrogel inhibit inflammation and facilitate cell proliferation and \nangiogenesis. The remodeling phase involves low-intensity laser-based \nphototherapy to modulate myofibroblast activity and collagen remodeling, \npreventing hypertrophic scarring. Conclusions: The dynamic photoresponsive \nproperties of PCCUR by introducing a 3R paradigm (Remove-Residual tumor \ncells/bacteria; Remodel-Immune microenvironment; Repair-Skin tissue) provide a \nsafe and efficient therapeutic approach tailored to the three stages of wound \nhealing, making it a promising dressing option for the comprehensive management \nof postoperative wounds in melanoma patients.", "\u00a9 The author(s).", "DOI: 10.7150/thno.113417\nPMCID: PMC12316037\nPMID: 40756368 [Indexed for MEDLINE]", "Conflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: The authors have declared \nthat no competing interest exists.", "\n3.

Methods: In vitro cellular uptake and internalization \nassays, as well as survival assays (colony forming) were performed in GPA33- and \nHER2-positive SW1222 human CRC cells. In vivo biodistribution and therapy \nstudies were performed with two human CRC xenograft mouse models. Results: For \nboth antigens, treatment with up to 74 kBq 225Ac-DOTA-PRIT in SW1222-tumored \nmice significantly enhanced overall survival in comparison to controls, \nincluding histologic cures. The uptake of 225Ac at the tumor correlated with \nantigen expression (antigen expression for GPA33:HER2 is 5:1). Cellular assays \nshowed no significant differences in internalized fraction or nucleus-associated \nradioactivity between the two targets. GPA33 had a higher absorbed dose to the \nnucleus (1.3 Gy vs. 0.65 Gy for HER2), resulting in reduced clonogenic survival. \nA single cycle of either GPA33 or HER2 DOTA-PRIT (37 kBq; 193.31 Gy and 113.91 \nGy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE] = 5), respectively) was equally \neffective.

This study aims to investigate the \nanticancer effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of THM in pancreatic \ncancer cells. Methods: In this study, the effects of THM on pancreatic cancer \ncells were investigated by various experiments both in vitro and in vivo. The \nmolecular target of THM in pancreatic cancer cells was determined by \ntranscriptomics, ligand coupled epoxy-activated magnetic beads, CETSA, SPR \nanalysis, ITC analysis, LC-MS/MS analysis, and MD simulations. Results: Our \nfindings reveal that THM significantly suppresses pancreatic cancer cell \nproliferation and induces cell death. Autophagic cell death is demonstrated to \npredominantly contribute to THM-triggered cell death. Importantly, YTHDF2, the \nm6A reader protein, is identified as a direct anticancer target of THM. Further \ninvestigations have shown that THM binds to YTHDF2, blocking its ability to \nrecognize m6A modifications on the autophagy-related gene mRNAs ATG5 and ATG7. \nNotably, a medium dose of THM exhibits anticancer efficacy comparable to \ngemcitabine (GEM), the first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer, and the high \ndose of THM showing superior anticancer effects than GEM treatment. Moreover, \nTHM enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer \nmodels. Conclusions: This study presents the first evidence that THM promotes \ncell death in pancreatic cancer cells by inducing autophagy and YTHDF2 is \nidentified as a direct binding target of THM. Targeting YTHDF2 is a critical \ndeterminer for THM-induced autophagic cell death and the immunosensitizing \neffect of THM with anti-PD-1 inhibitor in pancreatic cancer.

Western blot, \nimmunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and biochemical kits \nwere applied to elucidate the molecular mechanism of cuproptosis triggered by \nRAP-LPs@ESCu. Orthotopic GBM models were established by stereotactic \nimplantation of luciferase-labeled LN229 cells into the right striatum of \nBALB/c-nu mice. In vivo imaging system was utilized to monitor tumor progression \nand blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Copper content in tumor tissues was \nquantified by biochemical kit, and mitochondrial morphology was examined by TEM. \nSystemic toxicity of RAP-LPs@ESCu was evaluated through hematological, \nbiochemical, hemolysis assays, and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Neurological and \nmotor functions were assessed using the Loga 5-score test and open-field test. \nResults: Through systematic evaluation in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, \nwe found that RAP-LPs@ESCu effectively induced cuproptosis, inhibited GBM \nprogression, and significantly prolonged survival. Mechanistic studies revealed \nthat RAP-mediated targeting resulted in efficient BBB penetration and \npreferential accumulation of ESCu in tumor cells. Subsequent intracellular Cu\u00b2\u207a \noverload triggered a cascade of molecular events beginning with substantial \nupregulation of FDX1 expression, followed by accumulation of lipoylated \ndihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase aggregates, and finally depletion of \niron-sulfur cluster proteins.

There are very few targeted treatment options with satisfactory \ntherapeutic indexes for TNBC. Although chemotherapy is the principal treatment \nmodality for TNBC, its effectiveness is significantly compromised by low \nchemosensitivity in the TNBC patient population. Recent evidence has suggested \nthat metabolic adaptation of tumor cells may play a critical role in reducing \ntherapeutic responses. Metabolic interventions could enhance chemosensitivity \nand improve chemotherapeutic efficacy. Methods: The influence of oxidative \nphosphorylation (OXPHOS) on TNBC chemosensitivity was evaluated by integrating \nbioinformatic analyses of patient datasets with metabolic phenotyping of TNBC \ncells. The correlation was established between the level of OXPHOS gene \nexpression and therapeutic responses to standard chemotherapeutics. A \nmitochondria-targeting OXPHOS inhibitor, TPP-LND (a mitochondria-targeting \nderivative of lonidamine), was synthesized. A dendron-based polymer was \nconjugated with epirubicin (EPI) via an acid-responsive hydrazone bond to form a \nnanocarrier. TPP-LND was subsequently encapsulated into this nanocarrier, \nyielding PEG-Dendron-EPI@TPP-LND. Results: In TCGA-BRCA cohorts, an elevation in \nOXPHOS gene expression was correlated with poor clinical outcomes and a higher \nIC50 value of chemotherapeutic drugs like EPI was found in the patients with \nupregulated OXPHOS expression, suggesting diminished chemosensitivity in these \npatients. TNBC cells heavily relied on mitochondrial ATP production, and TPP-LND \neffectively inhibited OXPHOS. PEG-Dendron-EPI@TPP-LND significantly suppressed \ntumor growth and prevented compensatory glycolytic activation without inducing \nobservable systemic toxicity in vivo. Conclusion: A mechanistic correlation was \nestablished between the OXPHOS activity and TNBC chemosensitivity. OXPHOS \ninhibition via TPP-LND was synergized with chemotherapy via the EPI prodrug to \neffectively suppress tumor growth and mitigate systemic toxicity of TPP-LND and \nEPI.

Despite the introduction of many novel targeted agents, \ncytotoxic chemotherapy has remained the standard of care for AML. Differences in \nmitochondrial metabolism between normal and leukemic cells can be targeted by \nnovel AML therapies, but these agents require a comprehensive efficacy and \ncytotoxicity evaluation.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Metabolic alterations in AML blasts increase their sensitivity \nto therapies targeting mitochondrial metabolism. Targeting altered mitochondrial \nmetabolism, that is crucial for leukemia cell growth and survival, could be a \nbreakthrough in AML treatment. Therefore, BH3 family proteins, mitochondrial \ncomplexes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid (AA) and fatty acid \nmetabolism are common treatment targets in AML. Although many drugs targeting \nthese vulnerabilities showed acceptable safety profiles and promising efficacy \nin preclinical studies, clinical trials often do not confirm these results \nlimited by narrow therapeutic window. The most effective regimens are based on \ndrug combinations with synergistic or additive activity.\nSUMMARY: In this review, we present an overview of the most recent studies \ntargeting mitochondrial metabolism in AML. We highlight that targeting of the \nspecific energy metabolism dependencies of AML blasts provides an opportunity to \nachieve long-term responses with a reasonable safety profile. We emphasize that \ncurrently used drugs and their combinations display dose-limiting toxicities or \nare not efficient enough to completely eradicate leukemic stem cells.

Performance was assessed using the integrated area under the curve \n(iAUC), calibration, decision curve analysis (DCA), and incremental value over \nclinical models (pTNM, UISS, and Leibovich) for the prediction of disease-free \nsurvival (DFS).\nKEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 166 patients (training set: n\u00a0=\u00a0117; \ntest set: n\u00a0=\u00a049) were included. The primary tumor RS achieved an iAUC of 0.69, \nthe TT RS achieved 0.78, and the primary tumor\u00a0+\u00a0TT RS achieved 0.82. \nIncorporation of TT radiomics enhanced the predictive accuracy of clinical \nmodels significantly, with iAUC increases from 0.58 to 0.83 for pTNM, 0.64 to \n0.83 for UISS, and 0.66 to 0.83 for Leibovich scores (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The DCA \nconfirmed the clinical utility of integrating radiomic features, particularly TT \nradiomics, into recurrence risk assessment. The retrospective design and absence \nof external validation in independent, multicenter cohorts limit the \ngeneralizability of these findings.\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Tumor thrombus radiomic profiling \nimproves DFS prediction significantly and adds complementary prognostic value to \nestablished models in patients with ccRCC. Incorporation of these features into \nclinical workflows may enhance risk stratification and guide personalized \ntreatment planning. Prospective validation in large, multicenter cohorts is \nwarranted to support clinical adoption.\nPATIENT SUMMARY: This study focused on kidney cancer with tumor thrombus and \ndemonstrated that an analysis of the imaging features from the thrombus improved \nthe prediction of cancer recurrence significantly.

In addition to oncologic manifestations, \nindividuals with NF1 face a heightened risk of developing secondary skeletal \ncomplications associated with somatic loss-of-heterozygosity. Long bone \ndysplasia and post-fracture pseudarthrosis are among the earliest skeletal \nmanifestations observed in children with NF1.

While early-stage CM \ntypically carries a favorable prognosis, a small subset of patients relapses and \nprogresses to advanced disease, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding \nof CM biology. Here, we describe the establishment and characterization of a \nnovel patient-derived primary cell line, MelT79, developed from a metastatic \nlesion of a patient initially diagnosed with stage IB CM, who unexpectedly \nprogressed to advanced disease.\nMETHODS: MelT79 was characterized by multicolor fluorescence in situ \nhybridization, high resolution comparative genomic hybridization, and targeted \nnext-generation sequencing. Gene and protein expression were evaluated by \nRT-qPCR and immunofluorescence, and cell proliferation was assessed using trypan \nblue exclusion and BrdU incorporation assays. Sensitivity to BRAF inhibition was \nmeasured with the Cell Counting Kit-8 viability assay. Gene and protein \nexpression, proliferation, and drug sensitivity were compared to commercially \navailable CM cell lines.\nRESULTS: MelT79 exhibits a complex karyotype with significant chromosomal \nalterations, including deletions affecting key genes such as CDKN2A/B, SPRED1, \nand B2M, implicated in melanomagenesis and therapy resistance. Additionally, \nMelT79 harbors both the BRAF V600E mutation and a rare RET S649L mutation, which \nhas not been previously reported in CM. RET S649L was also identified in an \nearlier metastatic lesion, possibly conferring a selective advantage, and \nhighlighting this mutation as a potential therapeutic target. Phenotypically, \nMelT79 displays both differentiation and invasive traits, suggesting that its \nheterogeneity might contribute to progression and therapy resistance. \nFurthermore, the cell line exhibited moderate sensitivity to BRAF and MEK \ninhibitors when compared to other commercially available cell lines, reflecting \nits heterogeneity.\nCONCLUSION: MelT79 represents a valuable model for understanding CM \nheterogeneity, progression, and resistance mechanisms, offering new avenues for \nnovel therapeutic interventions in CM.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 Tom\u00e1s, Roque, Francisco, Silva, Nunes, Gouveia, Carvalho, \nFarricha, Moura, Rosa, Garrido, Albuquerque, Pereira, Cabral and Pojo.", "DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2025.1531013\nPMCID: PMC12313697\nPMID: 40756116", "Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.", "\n29.

To the \nbest of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of its kind in Tanzania. \nCase History: We report the rare case of a 46-year-old, P1L1, premenopausal \nwoman living with HIV who presented with a rapidly enlarging, painful right \nvulvar mass with ulceration and foul discharge for 7\u2009months. Pelvic examination \nrevealed a large firm, friable mass with an ulcerated, erythematous surface \ninvolving the right labia majora, posterior fourchette, and perineum.

A pelvic Magnetic \nResonance Imaging (MRI) with and without IV contrast confirmed the presence of \nan ulcerated mass arising in the right labium measuring 6\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009cm. Prominent and \nenhancing bilateral inguinal-femoral lymph nodes were identified, the largest \nnoted in the right inguinal region, measuring 4\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009cm. The radiological \nfindings were suggestive of a right labial ulcerative malignant mass with \ninguinal-femoral lymphadenopathy.

An 82-year-old Arab male with a history of Gleason \n4\u2009+\u20094\u2009=\u20098 prostate adenocarcinoma (initially managed with hormonal therapy and \nsurgical castration) presented with right back pain. Imaging revealed stage 4 \nhydronephrosis, initially attributed to a ureteral stone. Ureteroscopy \nidentified obstructing ureteral tumors instead, with biopsy confirming \nwell-differentiated adenocarcinoma of prostatic origin. Due to persistent \nobstruction and confirmed malignancy, a right nephroureterectomy was performed. \nHistopathology demonstrated extensive ureteral involvement (16\u2009cm) with vascular \nand perineural invasion but no distant metastasis on postoperative PET-CT. This \ncase underscores the diagnostic challenge of ureteral metastasis in prostate \ncancer, often mimicking benign conditions like ureteral stones. Despite \nsuccessful local surgical control, the tumor's aggressive features necessitate \nlong-term surveillance and continued hormonal therapy. High clinical suspicion \nfor metastasis is crucial in high-risk prostate cancer patients presenting with \nobstructive uropathy, even in the absence of significantly elevated PSA. This \nreport highlights the importance of a stepwise diagnostic approach and the need \nfor prompt intervention in such rare presentations.", "\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Although less common, \nnon-hematological autoimmune manifestations have been observed. Myasthenia \ngravis (MG) is rarely found in association with CLL. Since 1967, only 27 \npublications have reported the association between CLL and MG, encompassing just \n15 cases. Our case is particularly notable for the refractory nature of the \npatient's MG.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old male with Rai Stage II CLL and myasthenia \ngravis presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress, \ndysphagia, and weakness. He was admitted for treatment with intravenous immune \nglobulin, pyridostigmine, and intravenous solumedrol. Notably, the patient was \ndiagnosed with CLL approximately three months prior and MG just one week before \npresentation. Despite aggressive treatment, the patient's myasthenia gravis \nsymptoms persisted, prompting suspicion of CLL-related complications. Due to the \npatient's refractory myasthenia gravis, weekly rituximab 375 mg/m2 was \ninitiated. He was given the first dose of rituximab during the hospital \nadmission after which his dysphagia clinically improved.Outpatient management \nincluded obinutuzumab and Ventoclax for CLL control, resulting in gradual \nresolution of MG symptoms over a few months.\nDISCUSSION: Patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) generally do not require \nroutine leukemia screening unless factors such as lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, \nor refractory MG warrant further evaluation. Conversely, symptoms like ptosis in \nchronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) should prompt MG assessment.

Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) \nis a serious condition that can be hard to treat. A recent clinical trial \n(NIAGARA) found that adding a drug called durvalumab to standard chemotherapy \nbefore surgery helps patients live longer and reduces the chance of cancer \nreturning. However, durvalumab is expensive, and it\u2019s important to understand if \nthe benefits justify the costs. This study looked at whether the combination of \ndurvalumab and chemotherapy provides good value for the money in the United \nStates. Using data from the NIAGARA trial, researchers created a model to \ncompare the total costs and health benefits of two treatments: chemotherapy \nalone versus chemotherapy with durvalumab. The model measured the costs, life \nexpectancy, and quality of life for patients over time. The results showed that \nadding durvalumab gives patients an extra 0.68 quality-adjusted life years \n(QALYs), which means more time in good health. However, this benefit comes at an \nadditional cost of $86,485. The cost-effectiveness of the treatment was measured \nusing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which was $93,693 per \nQALY gained. This amount is within the range that U.S. healthcare payers \ntypically consider acceptable for new treatments.

Annually, it claims the lives of approximately 207,000 women \nworldwide. Early detection is crucial, as most cases are diagnosed at advanced \nstages, resulting in a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. Common diagnostic \ntools include Cancer Antigen 125 (CA125) and ultrasound, but these methods are \nlimited by sensitivity, specificity, and operator dependence. The Risk of \nMalignancy Index (RMI) and the Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the Adnexa \n(ADNEX) model, which integrates ultrasound and CA125, offer improved diagnostic \naccuracy. This study aims to assess the knowledge and application of these \nmodels among gynecologists in Saudi Arabia.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 148 gynecologists from \nvarious hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Participants completed a structured \nquestionnaire that was distributed online, designed to evaluate their knowledge \nand application of the RMI and ADNEX models. Data were analyzed using \ndescriptive statistics, and factors influencing the utilization of these models \nwere identified through multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nRESULTS: The study found that 72% of the gynecologists were familiar with the \nRMI, and 58% were aware of the ADNEX model. However, only 46% reported regularly \nusing the RMI, and 32% used the ADNEX model in their practice.

As the most common type of primary liver \ncancer, HCC is associated with poor prognosis despite advancements in treatment \noptions such as radical resection, liver transplantation, and adjuvant \ntherapies. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of HCC treatment; however, \npostoperative recurrence and metastasis pose significant challenges to patient \nsurvival. Intraoperative factors, including immune suppression and the use of \ncertain anaesthetics, have been implicated in tumour cell dissemination and \nrecurrence. While anaesthetic agents like propofol are known to influence tumour \ncell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Ciprofol, a novel \nintravenous anaesthetic, has demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy, but its \npotential impact on HCC progression and underlying mechanisms requires further \nexploration. This study aims to explore how ciprofol affects the behaviour of \nHCC cells and the underlying mechanisms.\nMETHODS: Hep3B and HCCLM3 HCC cell lines were treated with varying \nconcentrations of ciprofol. The cell numbers were measured at different time \npoints using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) to find the active concentration. \nProliferation was assessed by colony formation and 5-ethynl-2'-deoxyuridine \n(EdU) assays, whereas invasion and migration were tested using Transwell and \nwound healing assays. Subcutaneous xenograft and orthotopic liver \ntransplantation models were used to study tumour growth in vivo, and a lung \nmetastasis model was created to examine its effects on metastasis. RNA \nsequencing (RNA-seq) identified transcriptional changes after ciprofol \ntreatment, and western blot and immunofluorescence (IF) validated these \nfindings.\nRESULTS: Ciprofol inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of Hep3B \nand HCCLM3 cells in a manner dependent on both time and dosage. It also reduced \ntumour growth and lung metastasis in mice. RNA-seq showed that ciprofol affected \nthe MAPK/ERK pathway, which was confirmed by the reduced phosphorylation levels \nof Raf, MEK, and ERK, without affecting total protein levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: Ciprofol inhibited the MAPK/ERK pathway by reducing the \nphosphorylation of Raf, MEK, and ERK, which may explain its inhibitory effects \non HCC.

Physical examination \nrevealed a tender, erythematous anal region with prolapsed tissue and persistent \nbleeding. She underwent a Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy and examination under \nanesthesia as the initial surgical approach. Intraoperatively, a friable \nexophytic lesion was identified 4 cm from the anal verge, occupying \napproximately 70% of the rectal lumen.

Liquid-based cytology \n(LBC) is a relatively newer technique that offers a cleaner background and fewer \nunsatisfactory smears. This study aimed to assess interobserver variability and \ncompare the diagnostic accuracy of LBC and CPS in the CC screening of high-risk \npatients. Materials and methods Split smears for CPS and LBC were prepared from \n402 high-risk patients. CPS slides were stained using the Papanicolaou method. \nAll CPS and LBC slides were initially reviewed by one cytopathologist and \nsubsequently reevaluated by a second cytopathologist, with reporting based on \nthe 2014 Bethesda System. In cases of discrepancy, the final diagnosis was \ndetermined by a third, senior cytopathologist. Biopsy confirmation was available \nin 52 cases. Interobserver variation was assessed using Kappa (\u03ba) statistics, \nwhile intraobserver variation (between CPS and LBC) was evaluated using \nPearson's correlation coefficient (r). Results The strength of interobserver \nagreement was classified as very good for LBC (\u03ba = 0.95) and good for CPS (\u03ba = \n0.79). Intraobserver agreement was high for observer 1 (r = 0.51) and moderate \nfor observer 2 (r = 0.48). Diagnostic accuracy was 100% for LBC and 70% for CPS. \nCPS had significantly more unsatisfactory smears compared to LBC (p < 0.05). \nConclusions Interobserver variability plays a critical role in diagnostic \naccuracy, patient care, and prognosis and has important medicolegal \nimplications.

While DM+DBT is gradually replacing DM in the United \nStates and other Western countries, its adoption in Japan has been limited. This \nstudy assessed and compared the diagnostic performance of DM and DM+DBT, with a \nnovel focus on breast density, reader experience, and workflow efficiency in \nJapanese women who underwent examinations during our early experience shortly \nafter the introduction of DBT. Methods A retrospective review of 48 patients (19 \nwith breast cancer and 29 with benign lesions) who underwent both DM and DBT at \nJyoban Hospital was conducted. Five readers (two physicians, one medical \nresident, and two radiologic technologists) assessed the images. Diagnostic \naccuracy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve \nanalysis for breast density and reader experience in both screening and clinical \nsettings. Inter-reader agreement and reading times were assessed, with paired \nt-tests used to analyze differences in reading times. Results DM+DBT achieved \nhigher inter-reader agreement than DM (Kappa: 0.708, 95% CI: 0.567-0.849 vs. \n0.661, 95% CI: 0.511-0.811), though this difference was not statistically \nsignificant (p = 0.653). In screening settings, DM+DBT significantly improved \nthe area under the curve (AUC; 0.750, 95% CI: 0.717-0.784 vs. 0.709, 95% CI: \n0.675-0.743; p = 0.005); in clinical settings, the increase was not significant \n(0.878, 95% CI: 0.834-0.921 vs. 0.844, 95% CI: 0.797-0.891; p = 0.153). For \ndense breasts, AUC improved notably with DBT (screening: 0.766, 95% CI: \n0.699-0.833 vs. 0.684, 95% CI: 0.612-0.756; p = 0.007; clinical: 0.936, 95% CI: \n0.883-0.990 vs. 0.827, 95% CI: 0.740-0.914; p = 0.023), but no significant \ndifferences were observed in non-dense breasts. All readers improved with DBT, \nexcept the medical resident. Reading times increased significantly, from \n32.5-82.5 seconds (DM) to 71.3-113.8 seconds (DM+DBT) (p = 0.006).

The following outcomes were \ninvestigated: \u226590 days from initial diagnosis to surgery, \u22658 weeks from \ndiagnosis to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and >120 days from \ndiagnosis to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy. Summary statistics were \nreported as percent for categorical data and as mean for continuous data. The \nindividual correlations were performed using Chi-square for qualitative data and \nt-test for quantitative data while predictors were determined through logistic \nregression.\nRESULTS: A total of 324 patients were included in this study. The majority of \nthe patients were less than 65 years old living in urban areas. More than half \nof the patients were overweight or obese, hypertensive, and diabetic. The \nfollowing delays were observed: 61.1% (n = 198) with any type of delay, 23.8% (n \n= 53) with delay in surgery, 53.8% (n = 120) with delay in adjuvant \nchemotherapy, and 74.3% (n = 75) with delay in neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The \npatients noted to have any type of delay were more likely to be hypertensive (p \n= 0.046) and residing in urban areas (p = 0.041). There were no differences in \nthe distribution of age, body mass index, and presence of co-morbid conditions \nsuch as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and heart \nfailure among those with any form of delay compared with no delay.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study shows the presence of treatment delay among \nbreast cancer patients and may be used to enact policy changes to optimize \nbreast cancer care delivery.

However, it can also \ncause cardiotoxicity. This study is performed to investigate whether rivaroxaban \n(RIV) attenuates SU-induced cardiotoxicity (SIC). Methods and Materials: AC16 \ncells and primary cardiomyocytes of neonatal mouse were treated with different \nconcentrations (2-10\u2009\u03bcM) of SU for 24\u2009h or with 6\u2009\u03bcM SU and 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL RIV for \n24\u2009h. The viability of cardiomyocytes was evaluated using the cell counting \nkit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and the apoptosis rate was evaluated using flow cytometry. \nThe activity of caspase-3 was determined. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), \nglutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were also measured. The \npotential targets and downstream pathways of RIV in SIC treatment were \ninvestigated using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular \ndynamics simulation. qPCR and western blotting were used to detect the \nregulatory effects of SU and RIV on mRNA and protein expression of MAPK \npathway-related genes, respectively. Results: RIV treatment alleviated \nSU-induced cardiomyocyte injury by promoting viability and inhibiting apoptosis, \noxidative stress, and the inflammatory response in AC16 cells and primary \ncardiomyocytes. Caspase 3 (CASP3), signal transducer and activator of \ntranscription 3 (STAT3), SRC proto-oncogene, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (SRC), \nATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), and ATP-binding cassette \nsubfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) were candidate targets of RIV in SIC. The binding \naffinities between RIV and CASP3, STAT3, SRC, ABCG2, and ABCB1 were all less \nthan -7.5\u2009kcal/mol, indicating that RIV could bind stably to these targets. \nBioinformatics analyses suggested that the mitogen-activated protein kinase \n(MAPK) pathway was involved in the mechanism by which RIV alleviated SIC. RIV \ntreatment decreased the mRNA expression of CASP3 and increased the mRNA \nexpression of STAT3, SRC, ABCG2, and ABCB1 in AC16 cells and primary \ncardiomyocytes. RIV also inhibited the SU-induced activation of the MAPK \npathway. Conclusion: RIV exerts a protective effect against SU-induced \ncardiomyocyte injury by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway.

The MnO2-PEI \nnanosheets shields AAV from immune and hepatic clearance, thus enhancing tumor \naccumulation. This addresses a key limitation of naked AAV delivery. \nSimultaneously, the AAV payload offsets non-viral systems' low gene delivery \nefficiency. The platform induces robust damage-associated molecular patterns \n(DAMP) and tumor antigen release, thereby promoting dendritic cell maturation \nand cytotoxic T cell infiltration.

Specially, during photodynamic therapy, which usually proceeds via \noxidation and nitration of the DNA bases of the cancer cells, protonation may \nresult in DNA structural deformation and consequently accelerate its \ndenaturation and destruction. In the present study, the effect of the \nprotonation of cytosine (at N3), along with the oxidation/nitration of guanine, \non the structural instability and possible denaturation of the double-strand \ndodecamer B-DNA has been investigated using ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics \n(RMD) simulations. Results of these RMD simulations show that protonation has a \nlarger impact on the oxo/nitro-modified B-DNA as compared to that on its \npristine structure. In addition, cytosine protonation (at N3) imposes higher \nstress on the dodecamer structure in the modified 8-nitroguanine B-DNA system \ncompared to that in the other two modified systems, 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole \nand 8-oxoguanine B-DNA. Detailed analysis of the results of the RMD simulations \nshows that protonation of modified 8-nitroguanine B-DNA results in a higher \nstructural fluctuation such that the number of the interstrand hydrogen bonds \ndecreases and water molecules find larger spaces to diffuse into the weakened \ndouble-strand structure and cause further expansion (both in width and length) \nof the B-DNA structure. While all modifications and protonations have been \napplied on the GC nucleobase pairs of the B-DNA molecule, their effects are more \nevident over the farther AT (7th) nucleobase pair, which belongs to the GAATTC \nsection of the B-DNA double helix named EcoRI, already known to be sensitive to \nany alteration in the B-DNA molecule. Our RMD simulations also show that this AT \n(7th) nucleobase pair is separated in the three modified B-DNA systems having \nN3-protonated cytosines, N3-protonated cytosine and 8-nitroguanine, and \nN3-protonated cytosine and 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole. As a conclusion, it can \nbe suggested that denaturation of the dodecamer B-DNA molecule starts probably \nfrom the EcoRI section of the molecule due to the breakage of the hydrogen bonds \nof its AT nucleobase pair.", "DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.5c02696\nPMID: 40755432", "\n47.

Based on whether cTRT or not, patients were allocated to cTRT \ngroup or non-cTRT group. We evaluated efficacy by using the median overall \nsurvival (mOS) and progression-free survival (mPFS) times, and safety by \nmeasuring the incidence of adverse events.\nRESULTS: During this study, 72 patients with ES-SCLC were enrolled, with a \nmedian follow-up of 34.66\u2009months. Twenty-nine patients received cTRT and 43 \npatients did not receive cTRT. Among the cTRT group and the non-cTRT group, the \nmPFS was 11.50 and 8.02\u2009months, respectively, with a HR of 0.60 (95% CI \n0.36-0.99, p\u2009=\u20090.043). The mOS in the cTRT group was also significantly longer \nthan that in the non-cTRT group (28.68\u2009months vs. 16.30\u2009months, HR = 0.56, 95% \nCI 0.32-0.96, p\u2009=\u20090.033). Based on multivariate analysis, cTRT and cycles of \nimmunotherapy \u2265 6 were independent factors affecting survival. There were no \ntreatment-related deaths and most adverse events were grade 1-2.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the addition of cTRT to first-line \nchemo-immunotherapy significantly improves survival in ES-SCLC with \nwell-tolerated toxicity.", "Plain Language Summary: There is a paucity of evidence regarding the efficacy \nand safety of consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (cTRT) after \nchemoimmunotherapy for ES-SCLC.We conducted a real-world study to investigate \nwhether cTRT is necessary in patients with ES-SCLC who responded well to \nchemoimmunotherapy.ES-SCLC patients treated with cTRT after first-line \nchemoimmunotherapy had prolonged PFS and OS with an acceptable safety profile in \nour study.", "DOI: 10.1080/07853890.2025.2542434\nPMID: 40755353 [Indexed for MEDLINE]", "\n3.

However, the clinical impact of CGP, as covered by \npublic health insurance in the management of sarcomas, remains unknown. \nEspecially, the data on the utility of the newly emerging dual DNA-RNA panel \ncompared to the conventional DNA-only panel in clinical settings is lacking. \nTherefore, we evaluated the utility of CGP in routine clinical practice for \nsarcoma treatment.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, three types of DNA panel and one DNA-RNA \npanel, reimbursed by Japanese public health insurance, were utilized. We \ndetected oncogenic and druggable gene mutations and genotype-matched therapies.\nRESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six patients were included in this study. Based \non the detection of highly histology-specific translocations in the sequencing \nresults, 2.2% of patients were re-classified. In patients with \ntranslocation-related sarcomas, a DNA-RNA panel identified more \nhistology-specific fusion genes than DNA panels (p\u2009=\u20090.0035). Specifically, \n86.8% and 39.0% of patients had oncogenic and druggable genomic alterations, \nrespectively. Of these, 9.6% underwent genotype-matched therapy, with a 36.3% \nresponse rate and an 81.8% disease control rate. Patients who were administered \ngenomically matched therapy had better overall survival (OS) than those who did \nnot in patients with metastatic or advanced sarcoma with no prior chemotherapy \n(3-year OS: 83.3% vs. 48.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.42). Patients with TP53 and RB1 mutations had \nworse OS than those without. Germline findings were detected in 11.0% of the \npatients, one of whom had a truly germline origin.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that publicly reimbursed CGP tests, \nparticularly the dual DNA-RNA panel, could be beneficial for refining diagnostic \nprecision in selected sarcoma subtypes, treatment decisions, detecting the \ngermline findings, and prognosis prediction in routine clinical settings for \nsarcoma.

HER3, a member of the \nHER family that is kinase impaired, has been shown to be a resistance mechanism \nupon inhibition of the HER family and downstream targets including RAS/MEK/ERK \nand PI3K/AKT.

Starting at 1 \ntablet twice daily, titrated over 6 weeks to a maximum of 12 tablets/day.\nOBJECTIVE: To estimate clinical effectiveness of methylphenidate versus placebo \nfor cancer-related fatigue in patients receiving palliative care.\nPRIMARY OUTCOME: Fatigue at 6 (\u00b1\u20052) weeks measured using the Functional \nAssessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue Scale score. Secondary outcomes \nwere fatigue at other time points; quality of life, adverse events, activities \nof daily living; appetite; anxiety; depression; patient satisfaction; survival \nand need for other medication.\nRANDOMISATION: Computer-generated 1\u2005:\u20051 randomisation, stratified by centre, \nconcomitant treatment, depression and initial fatigue score.\nBLINDING: Participants and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment.\nRESULTS: Eighty-four were allocated to methylphenidate and 78 to placebo.\nRECRUITMENT: : Study completed.\nNUMBERS ANALYSED: Seventy-five in methylphenidate group and 72 in placebo group \nwere included in analysis of primary outcome.\nOUTCOME: There was no statistically or clinically significant difference in \nprimary outcome between groups. Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy \n- Fatigue Scale scores were 1.97 points (95% confidence interval -0.95 to 4.90; \np\u2005=\u20050.186) higher (better) on methylphenidate than placebo.

Methylphenidate is a stimulant medicine which some \nprevious studies suggested might help cancer-related fatigue. We undertook a \nrandomised controlled trial to compare the effects of methylphenidate or placebo \n(an inactive dummy pill) on cancer-related fatigue and the frequency of side \neffects. We involved 162 patients with advanced cancer and fatigue at 17 \ndifferent centres (hospital, hospices and community services) into the trial. \nThey were randomly allocated to receive either methylphenidate or placebo \ntablets. The number of tablets was adjusted each week over the first 6 weeks of \nthe trial (depending on the response and/or presence of side effects). Each \nweek, participants were either contacted by telephone or seen at face-to-face \nappointments to check on their well-being, response to treatment and side \neffects. After 6 weeks, the dose remained the same for a further 2 weeks, then \nwas reduced for a further week, then stopped altogether for the final week of \nthe trial. After 6, plus or minus 2, weeks of treatment, we found that people \ngiven methylphenidate had a small improvement in fatigue that was not \nstatistically significant and that was too small to be clinically important. \nParticipants given methylphenidate reported some improvements in fatigue at \nother times (weeks 2\u20136 and week 8) that may not be explained by chance, but \nwhich were nonetheless still not large enough to be considered clinically \nimportant. There was no difference in frequency of serious (life-threatening) \nside effects or death in the two groups. Nor were there any major differences in \nfrequency of other (mild, moderate or severe) side effects.

This modelling is reliable (rS = 0.82 \nbetween five-fold cross-validation and HoCoS). The correlation reaches 0.89 when \nincluding associated factors in the modelling, while maintaining a high \nreliability (rS = 0.70 between five-fold cross-validation and HoCoS).\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The use of automatic speech analysis allows a \nreliable prediction of the communication and speech impairment experienced by \nthe patients. This study opens up new perspectives for the use of automatic \nspeech recognition systems in clinical evaluation and for the consideration of \nfunctional and psychosocial needs expressed by the patients during their \nfollow-up.\nWHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on the subject Automatic and \nacoustic analyses compensate for the biases of perceptual speech assessment in \nclinical practice. Although they are used to assess speech severity, few studies \nhave examined their contribution to the measurement of communication and speech \nimpairment, which is yet an essential objective of clinical intervention. What \nthis paper adds to the existing knowledge Acoustic and automatic analyses (and \nin particular the use of automatic speech recognition systems) enable good \nprediction of communication and speech impairment reported by patients, with a \nlimited number of tools and parameters. This prediction is even improved by \nadding to the models scores from self-questionnaires measuring functional and \npsychosocial dimensions that may be impacted by the speech disorder. This study \nprovides reliable new tools for measuring impaired communication. What are the \npotential or actual clinical implications of this work? Acoustic and automatic \ntools can be used in routine clinical care to obtain a valid and reliable \nmeasure of communication and speech impairment. This prediction leads to a \nfollow-up score to quantify the level of communication and speech impairment at \na given time and the evolution of patients from a speech sample.", "\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Anisotropic, natural, and cost-effective \nnano-vectors, such as halloysite nanotubes (HNT), can be utilized for this \npurpose. In this study, we loaded the HNT with the apolar photosensitizers (PS) \n5,10,15,20-tetrakis(perfluorophenyl)porphyrin (H2TPPF20) and its Zn(II) complex \n(ZnTPPF20) to produce singlet oxygen for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The loading \nwas achieved through repeated vacuum/N2 cycles using both pristine HNT and HNT \nmodified with tetradecylphosphonic acid (HNT-TDP) to promote the uptake of the \nlipophilic PS in the inner lumen. To slow down the release of PS from HNT, the \nnanotubes were treated with dextrin. The ability of the free base and Zn \nperfluorinated porphyrins to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) was confirmed by \nirradiating the samples with a low-power visible LED emitter (23 mW cm-2), \nshowing a 1O2 quantum yield of 22% and 34%, respectively, in ethanol. The \ncharacterization of the nanocomposite is not trivial, so we employed a wide \nrange of analytical techniques to investigate the material thoroughly, \nparticularly the location of PS within the HNT. All nano-hybrids were analyzed \nby attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-FTIR), diffuse reflectance (DRS) \nand solid-state emission spectroscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used \nto determine the loading capacity of HNT. To better understand the interactions \nbetween the PS and the nanoclay, we compared all the loaded HNT samples with \nmechanically mixed HNT and solid H2TPPF20 or ZnTPPF20 samples, where the \ninteraction with the HNT inner lumen is assumed to be absent. We measured the \nrelease kinetics using UV-vis spectroscopy, observing a delayed release of the \nPS. Finally, we studied the cellular uptake of pristine HNT and a loaded sample \n(HNT-TDP-H2TPPF20-dextrin) by confocal microscopy using three distinct tumor \ncell lines. The cytotoxicity on PC3, 5637 and UMUC3 cells was then assessed as \nreduction of cell viability both on cells left in the dark and those irradiated \nwith a visible light emitting LED (1.3 mW cm-2), ascertaining the ability to \ninduce cell death especially after light administration.", "DOI: 10.1039/d5nr01078k\nPMID: 40755155", "\n26.

Astragalus membranaceus (AST) is \na traditional Chinese medicine used to invigorate Qi and strengthen the body, \nwith anti-fibrosis properties. However, the effect and mechanism of AST on OSF \nremain unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the mechanism of Astragalus membranaceus \nin OSF using network pharmacology and to validate its effects on oral mucosal \nfibroblasts through in-vitro experiments.\nMETHODS: Network pharmacology was employed to construct an \"AST - ingredient - \ntarget - OSF\" network and perform Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis. \nMolecular docking was used to confirm core interactions between key targets and \ningredients, and all results met the criterion of a binding energy of <- -1.2 \nkcal/mol. In-vitro experiments were conducted to assess the cytotoxicity of \narecoline (ARE) and Astragalus membranaceus injection (ASI) on Oral Mucosal \nFibroblasts (OMF).\nRESULTS: Analysis revealed 68 common targets between AST and OSF, and a \ncorresponding PPI network was constructed. KEGG and GO enrichment analyses \nidentified 138 pathways and 178 biological processes associated with these \ntargets. Molecular docking confirmed core interactions between five key targets \n(EGFR, VEGFA, MAPK3, HRAS, JUN) and other ingredients. In-vitro experiments \nshowed that ARE at concentrations of 20-40 \u03bcg/ml significantly upregulated \nACTA2, EGFR, and VEGFA mRNA expression. ASI treatment at varying concentrations \nsignificantly inhibited these increases, with 100 mg/ml ASI downregulating EGFR \nand VEGFA mRNA, and 300-400 mg/ml ASI reducing ACTA2 expression.\nCONCLUSION: Astragalus membranaceus injection may suppress ARE-induced fibrosis \nby targeting EGFR and VEGFA, supporting its potential therapeutic role in the \ntreatment of OSF.", "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at \nepub@benthamscience.net.", "DOI: 10.2174/0113816128374420250707120128\nPMID: 40755102", "\n33.

We report a unique case of a \ncolon cancer patient treated with pembrolizumab who acutely developed \nlife-threatening hypercalcemia.\nCASE PRESENTATION: This case presents a seventy-five-year-old woman suffering \nfrom colon adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis undergoing pembrolizumab \ntherapy. Shortly after its second administration, she developed severe \nhypercalcemia (21 mg/dL) with acute kidney failure. Serum intact parathyroid \nhormone (PTH), parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), 25-OH vitamin D, and \n1,25-OH vitamin D were suppressed while computerized tomography (CT) imaging \nruled out relevant osteolytic or granulomatous lesions. Treatment included \nhydration, infusion of zoledronic acid, and high-dose glucocorticoids. The \npatient's serum calcium levels normalized, andher condition improved. Primary \nhyperparathyroidism, ectopic PTHrP secretion, and ectopic 25(OH) D-1-hydroxylase \nexpression were ruled out by clinical and laboratory data. Notably, experimental \nmodels of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition have demonstrated increased bone resorption. \nAlthough the absence of specific bone turnover markers and a recent 18FDG-PET/CT \nscan partly limits the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism, \nimmune-mediated osteoclast activation represents a potential pathophysiological \nmechanism of acute reversible hypercalcemia.\nCONCLUSION: The present case is unique due to its early onset, absence of \ncalcitriol and PTHrP elevation, and rapid response to corticosteroids.

Preoperative enhanced CT images were analyzed using ITK-SNAP for \nregion-of-interest delineation, and radiomics features were extracted via A.K. \nsoftware. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm \nselected features to generate a radiomics score. Multivariate logistic \nregression identified independent risk factors, and a radiomics nomogram \ncombining clinical features and radiomics signatures was developed. Model \nperformance was evaluated using AUC in both training and validation sets.\nRESULTS: Nineteen radiomics features were selected to construct the radiomics \nsignature. The signature achieved an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84-0.95) in the \ntraining set and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.63-0.95) in the validation set. The radiomics \nnomogram demonstrated superior performance (AUC=0.80, 95% CI: 0.63-0.97) \ncompared to the clinical model alone (AUC=0.66, 95% CI: 0.47-0.85) in the \nvalidation set. While the nomogram showed no statistically significant \nimprovement over the radiomics signature alone (P>0.05), it outperformed the \nclinical model significantly (P<0.001 in training; P=0.0337 in validation).\nDISCUSSION: The radiomics nomogram integrating clinical and radiomics data \ndemonstrated robust predictive capability for ALK mutations, highlighting the \npotential of non-invasive CT-based radiomics in guiding personalized treatment. \nHowever, the lack of significant difference between the nomogram and radiomics \nsignature alone suggests limited incremental value from clinical variables in \nthis cohort. Limitations include the retrospective design, single-center data, \nand class imbalance (fewer ALK-positive cases), which may affect \ngeneralizability. External validation is warranted to confirm clinical utility.\nCONCLUSION: The CT-derived radiomics signature and nomogram show promise for \npreoperative ALK mutation prediction in lung adenocarcinoma.

Altered expression and/or function of these receptors \nmay be involved in the etiology of several diseases. Here we report the altered \noverall expression of SLAM family receptors (SFR) in leukemia cells from \npediatric patients. Additionally, we found that the expression of a single type \nof SLAM receptor in leukemia target cells was sufficient to upregulate the \nrelease of cytotoxic granules from primary NK cells. Moreover, coating the \nleukemia cell surface with specific engagers containing recombinant SFR was \nsufficient to enhance NK-cell degranulation and unleash the cytotoxic competence \nof primary NK cells from ALL patients.

Since rs1051730 is a synonymous variant at CHRNA3 \n(cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 3 subunit), it might be hypothesized that \nthe causal variant might be other SNP(s) in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD).\nMETHODS: LD analysis and functional genomics work, including chromosome \nconformation capture (3C), luciferase assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation \n(ChIP), were performed.\nRESULTS: Allele-specific expression indicates an overexpression of C allele than \nT at rs1051730 in lung tissues, thus verifying the hypothesis. Through LD \nanalysis for 1000 genomes project data, 17 genetic variants are identified in \nstrong LD with rs1051730. 3C indicates that two restrictive segments, \nchr15:78845145-78852557 and chr15:78867861-78872762, display high interaction \nefficiency with CHRNA3 promoter and contain two SNPs in core haplotype, \nrs72740964 and rs2036527, respectively.

We developed a remote loading method utilizing a \ncalcium acetate gradient to encapsulate MXD into liposomes, achieving a high MXD \nencapsulation efficiency (87%).

The stability of interaction between \nCLDN-1 and MXD was confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. \nImmunohistochemistry and gene expression analyses in mouse models of colorectal \n(CRC) and pancreatic (PCa) cancers revealed that Lip-MXD administration \nsignificantly reduced the number of tumor-associated stromal cells.

Their efficient capture and precise \nanalysis are significant for advancing precision medicine in cancer treatment. \nHowever, CTCs are extremely rare in the bloodstream, and their phenotypes change \nduring the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), posing significant \nchallenges for effective capture of CTCs.

To address these issues, this study proposes \ndual-aptamer functionalized cell membrane biomimetic magnetic nanoparticles \n(CCM-IMBs) to efficiently capture CTCs.

Additionally, \nthere is a notable absence of reports from China in this field.

After screening, 2,909 patients were randomized into training and \nvalidation cohorts (7:3). Using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient \nBoosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, and SHapley \nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP), the best predicting pathological complete response \n(pCR) model was identified, and key features were interpreted.

SHAP analysis indicated that ER, HER2 status, ALI, and albumin \n(Alb) level were the four most important features. The prognostic model was also \nvalidated by high AUC values in both training and test sets.

Her clinical presentation included recurrent parotid gland enlargement \naccompanied by sicca symptoms, notably persistent xerostomia and xerophthalmia, \nfollowed by progressive dental caries. Serological studies demonstrated \npositivity for antinuclear antibodies, anti-SSA/Ro, and anti-\u03b1-fodrin \nantibodies. Objective assessments confirmed significant ocular involvement \n(Schirmer' s test \u22645 mm/5 min) and pulmonary interstitial changes on chest CT, \nconsistent with the 2016 American College of Rheumatology and European League \nAgainst Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for SjD. The patient' s \ncondition remained stable under low-dose corticosteroids and disease-modifying \nanti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) until the recent onset of prolonged fever, \nnecessitating evaluation for fever of unknown origin. Differential diagnoses \nconsidered disease flare, infection, and malignancy. The European Sj\u00f6gren' s \nSyndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) score was 5 points, indicating moderate \nsystemic disease activity. Initial laboratory investigations revealed no \nevidence of infection, and empirical anti-infective therapy proved ineffective. \nNotably, despite the absence of lymphadenopathy, laboratory findings including \nborderline positive IgM \u03bb M-protein, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, \nhyperferritinemia, and increased \u03b22-microglobulin levels raised suspicion for \nlymphoproliferative disorders, given the established association between SjD and \nlymphoma. Bone marrow aspiration showed no significant abnormalities, but PET/CT \nimaging detected hypermetabolic lesions in the left breast and right distal \nfemur, suggesting potential malignancy. Subsequent histopathological examination \nof the breast lesion confirmed non-Hodgkin' s lymphoma (NHL), specifically \ndiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the germinal center B-cell (GCB) \nsubtype. Treatment with R-CHOP chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) induced complete metabolic remission \nafter three cycles. However, she subsequently developed treatment-related \ncomplications, including myelosuppression and pulmonary infection. This case \nunderscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for atypical \nsite involvement in SjD patients, particularly when lymphoma risk factors are \npresent. Comprehensive differential diagnosis should include lymphoma and other \nmalignancies, and the diagnostic value of PET/CT and histopathological \nexamination in disease evaluation is emphasized. SjD complicated by breast \nlymphoma is exceptionally rare, and its pathogenesis may involve lymphocytic \ninfiltration, abnormal activation of lymphocytes, formation of ectopic germinal \ncenters in the breast, and eventual malignant transformation.

Multivariate Logistic regression analysis \ndemonstrated that the percentage of positive biopsy cores (OR=91.24, 95%CI: \n13.34-968.68), PI-RADS score (OR=7.64, 95%CI: 1.78-138.06), and MRI-LNI \n(OR=4.67, 95%CI: 1.74-13.24) were independent risk factors for PLNM. And a novel \nnomogram for predicting PLNM was developed by integrating all these three \nvariables. Compared with the individual predictors: percentage of positive \nbiopsy cores [area under curve (AUC)=0.806], PI-RADS score (AUC=0.679), and \nMRI-LNI (AUC=0.768), the multivariate model incorporating all three variables \ndemonstrated significantly superior predictive performance (AUC=0.883). \nConsistently, calibration curves and decision curve analyses confirmed that the \nmultivariable model had high predictive accuracy and provided significant net \nclinical benefit relative to single-variable models. And using a cutoff of 6%, \nthe multiparameter model missed only approximately 5.2% of PLNM cases (4/77), \nwhile reducing approximately 53% of ePLND procedures (139/267), demonstrating \nfavorable predictive efficacy.\nCONCLUSION: Percentage of positive biopsy cores, PI-RADS score and MRI-LNI are \nindependent risk factors for PLNM.

Ureteral strictures were classified \naccording to anatomical location into upper, middle, lower, or multiple \nsegments. Surgical procedures were carried out depending on the stricture \ncharacteristics. Surgical success was defined as resolution or improvement of \nclinical symptoms, radiographic improvement or stabilization of hydronephrosis, \nand maintenance of normal and stable renal function.\nRESULTS: Among the 71 patients, 36 (50.7%) had strictures in the upper ureter, 9 \n(12.7%) in the middle ureter, 15 (21.1%) in the lower ureter, and 11 (15.5%) had \nmultifocal ureteral strictures.

The study found that NICT resulted \nin significantly higher rates of pCR (27.47% vs. 13.33%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and MPR \n(52.75% vs. 35.83%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to NCT. DFS was also significantly \nimproved in the NICT group (p\u2009=\u20090.005). Moreover, the incidence of respiratory \ncomplications was lower in the NICT group (68.13% vs. 80.00%, p\u2009=\u20090.049).\nCONCLUSIONS: NICT demonstrated superior efficacy over NCT in improving \npathological responses and survival outcomes, while also reducing perioperative \ncomplications. These findings suggest NICT could be a promising treatment option \nfor LA-ESCC.", "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

Unfortunately, there are currently no specific therapies for \nmetastatic tumors harboring BAP1 mutations. In this study, we have identified a \nnew targetable BAP1-associated autophagic vulnerability. We demonstrate that \nBAP1 transcriptionally regulates the proto-oncogene SRC, a non-receptor tyrosine \nkinase. SRC then binds to, phosphorylates, and inactivates BECN1 (Beclin 1), an \nessential autophagy protein. This inhibits autophagy in cells derived from \nvarious cancer types with BAP1 mutations. Treatment of these cells with SRC \ninhibitors (such as dasatinib, bosutinib and saracatinib) and autophagy-inducing \ndrugs (such as Tat-BECN1, SW076956 and SW063058) demonstrated a synergistic \ninteraction between these compounds both in vitro and in ovo using a chick \nChorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) assay. Furthermore, ex vivo studies employing \npatient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) of uveal melanoma (UM) and clear-cell \nrenal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) as preclinical models have substantiated the \nsynergism of these drugs, preferentially in the context of BAP1 loss.

Additionally, the median survival \ntime for patients receiving aromatase inhibitors was notably longer at \n49.0\u00a0months compared to 42.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6\u00a0months for those on tamoxifen (P\u2009=\u20090.410). \nSimilarly, the aromatase inhibitor group exhibited a more extended median \nmetastasis-free survival time (42.0\u00a0months vs. 30.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u00a0months, P\u2009=\u20090.056) and \na more favorable survival time from metastasis to death (8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u00a0months vs. \n6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00a0months in the tamoxifen group, P\u2009=\u20090.142).\nCONCLUSION: These findings collectively suggest a consistent trend towards \nimproved treatment outcomes with aromatase inhibitors compared to tamoxifen.

However, \nsevere checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (CHILI), which can lead to \ntreatment discontinuation or death, occurs in up to 18% of the patients. The aim \nof this study is to evaluate the value of PET/CT radiomics analysis for the \ndetection of CHILI.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with CHILI grade 2 or higher who underwent liver \nfunction tests and liver biopsy were retrospectively included. Minors, patients \nwith cognitive impairments, and patients with viral infections were excluded \nfrom the study. The patients' liver and spleen were contoured on the anonymized \nPET/CT imaging data, followed by radiomics feature extraction. Principal \ncomponent analysis (PCA) and Bonferroni corrections were used for statistical \nanalysis and exploration of radiomics features related to CHILI.\nRESULTS: Sixteen patients were included and 110 radiomics features were \nextracted from PET images. Liver PCA-5 showed significance as well as one \nassociated feature but did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. \nSpleen PCA-5 differed significantly between CHILI and non-CHILI patients even \nafter Bonferroni correction, possibly linked to the higher metabolic function of \nthe spleen in autoimmune diseases due to the recruitment of immune cells.\nCONCLUSION: This pilot study identified statistically significant differences in \nPET-derived radiomics features of the spleen and observable changes in the liver \non PET/CT scans before and after the onset of CHILI. Identifying these features \ncould aid in diagnosing or predicting CHILI, potentially enabling personalized \ntreatment.

However, the oncologic \ncontrol afforded by RNU may be accompanied by significant renal function \ndecline. Data regarding patients with immediate end-stage renal disease (ESRD) \nafter RNU is limited. Herein, we investigate outcomes of patients undergoing RNU \nwho were dialysis-dependent prior to surgery or rendered anephric by surgery \nrelative to a matched control cohort.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We queried our multi-institutional RNU database to \nidentify patients with preoperative ESRD (n = 16) or solitary kidney (n = 12). \nWe matched these 1:2 to a control cohort of RNU patients using age, sex, \nCharlson Comorbidity Index, smoking status, and pathologic T-stage. Oncologic \nand survival outcomes were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nRESULTS: The two groups had similar baseline clinical and oncologic \ncharacteristics, including utilization of perioperative systemic therapy. There \nwas no significant difference in time to recurrence or cancer specific \nmortality. However, the dialysis cohort displayed a higher risk of overall \nmortality, with 3- and 5-year survival of 29% and 14%, compared to 60% and 57% \nin the control group (HR 2.13, P = 0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing RNU with immediate postoperative ESRD had \nsimilar oncologic outcomes but worse overall survival compared to matched \ncontrols. These results are likely related to the impact of ESRD and other \nnononcologic comorbidities, which must factor into treatment decisions.

Their structural \ncomplexity enables adaptive responses to diverse physiological demands. In \ncancer, mitochondria orchestrate multiple cellular processes critical to tumor \ndevelopment. Metabolic reprogramming enables cancer cells to exploit aerobic \nglycolysis, glutamine metabolism, and lipid alterations, supporting uncontrolled \ngrowth, survival, and treatment resistance. Genetic and epigenetic alterations \nin mitochondrial and nuclear DNA disrupt oxidative phosphorylation, \ntricarboxylic acid cycle dynamics, and redox homeostasis, driving oncogenic \nprogression. Mitochondrial dysfunction in tumors is highly heterogeneous, \ninfluencing disease phenotypes and treatment responses across cancer types. \nWithin the tumor microenvironment, mitochondria profoundly impact immune \nresponses by modulating T-cell survival and function, macrophage polarization, \nNK cell cytotoxicity, and neutrophil activation. They also mediate stromal cell \nfunctions, particularly in cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor endothelial \ncells. Although targeting mitochondrial function represents a promising \ntherapeutic strategy, mitochondrial heterogeneity and adaptive resistance \nmechanisms complicate interventional approaches. Advances in mitochondrial \ngenome editing, proteomics, and circulating mitochondrial DNA analysis have \nenhanced tumor diagnostic precision.

This highlights the need for a new framework encompassing the child's \nexperience, while also integrating family and clinician perspectives.\nOBJECTIVES: This narrative review introduces a novel pediatric theory of \nsymptoms developed through a comprehensive synthesis of published literature and \nexisting theory.\nMETHODS: The Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms was critically evaluated for \nempirical gaps and areas for enhancement. Through an iterative process of \nliterature review and theoretical refinement, we developed an adapted theory, \ncalled The Pediatric Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms (Pedi-TOUS).\nRESULTS: The Pedi-TOUS captures the multidimensional symptom experiences of \nchildren with cancer.

While a shorter latency period between BMZ \nadministration and delivery is associated with an increased risk of neonatal \nhypoglycemia in late preterm infants, the impact of the BMZ latency period on \nneonatal hypoglycemia in infants born at term (\u226537\u00a0weeks) has not been \npreviously characterized. Term infants without additional risk factors such as \ngrowth restriction or maternal diabetes are not routinely screened and may be at \nrisk for unrecognized neonatal hypoglycemia. The purpose of this study was to \ndetermine whether the latency period from antenatal BMZ administration to \ndelivery impacts the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia in term infants.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed maternal-infant dyads from the \nUniversity of Minnesota Obstetric Measures database (January 2017-August 2023) \nwho received BMZ during pregnancy and delivered at \u226537\u00a0weeks (N\u00a0=\u00a0758). The \nprimary outcome was incidence of early neonatal hypoglycemia, defined as a blood \nglucose level <40\u2009mg/dL within 48\u2009h of birth, in neonates exposed to BMZ \n<14\u00a0days (recent BMZ; N\u00a0=\u00a0161) vs. >14\u00a0days (remote BMZ; N\u00a0=\u00a0597) prior to \ndelivery. Secondary outcomes included incidence of severe neonatal hypoglycemia \n(blood glucose level <25\u2009mg/dL within 48\u2009h of birth) and treatment for neonatal \nhypoglycemia with dextrose gel or IV dextrose. Demographics, pregnancy \ncharacteristics, neonatal characteristics, and outcomes were summarized by time \nfrom last dose of BMZ to delivery.\nRESULTS: The most common indication for BMZ was pre-eclampsia/pregnancy-induced \nhypertension in the recent BMZ group and preterm labor with intact membranes in \nthe remote BMZ group (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Maternal diabetes status did not differ between \ngroups. The recent BMZ group had lower median GA at birth (37.1 vs. 38.4\u00a0weeks, \np\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and lower birth weight (3.03 vs. 3.29\u2009kg, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The percentage of \nneonates classified as small for GA or large for GA was similar between groups. \nApproximately 30% of the neonates had a documented glucose measurement within \n48\u2009h of birth. The incidence of early neonatal hypoglycemia, severe \nhypoglycemia, and treatment for hypoglycemia with dextrose gel or IV dextrose \ndid not differ between infants exposed to recent BMZ vs. those exposed to remote \nBMZ.\nDISCUSSION: In this cohort of term infants, a shorter latency period between BMZ \nadministration and delivery was not associated with increased incidence or \ntreatment of hypoglycemia. However, the rate of hypoglycemia screening was low \nin both groups and rates of undiagnosed hypoglycemia in BMZ-exposed term \nneonates remain unknown.

Patients were sequentially allocated to CBCTA (n=53) or CECT \n(n=26) groups based on modality availability. The primary outcome was technique \nefficacy, defined by absence of tumor on imaging immediately post-procedure, at \n1-3 months, and 4-6 months. Secondary endpoints included procedural time, \neffective radiation dose, and 30-day adverse events. Comparisons used t-tests, \nFisher's test, and Mann-Whitney U tests (p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nRESULTS: Technique efficacy was comparable between CBCTA and CECT at all time \npoints: immediate (technical success) (100% vs. 100%, p=1.000), 1-3 months (87% \nvs. 73%, p=0.208), and 4-6 months (81% vs. 71%, p=0.463). No significant \ndifferences were found in radiation dose (37.96 vs. 32.36 mSv, p=0.276) or \nadverse events (11% vs. 11%, p=1.000).

Respondents were surveyed on cancer-related symptoms and side effects \nalong with their activities of daily living (ADL) and physical activity (PA). We \ncalculated weighted percentages and Rao-Scott chi-square tests for reported \ndifferences between rural and urban survivors. Rural/urban status was determined \nusing Rural Urban Continuum Codes.\nRESULTS: Rural and urban cancer survivors did not differ in their reporting of \nsymptoms or side effects, with each group reporting approximately 20\u202f% or \ngreater prevalence of each assessed symptom or side effect. For ADLs, rural \ncancer survivors more frequently reported difficulty dressing/bathing compared \nto their urban counterparts (7.7\u202f% vs. 3.1\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.02), but there were no \nstatistically significant differences for other ADLs. A higher percentage of \nurban cancer survivors compared to rural reported meeting aerobic PA \nrecommendations of \u2265150\u202fmin moderate intensity activity per week (47.9\u202f% vs. \n33.8\u202f%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: While many cancer survivors report symptoms and side effects of \ncancer treatment, no substantial variations existed by rurality. Important \nexceptions to this was that rural cancer survivors reported greater difficulty \nwith bathing and dressing, and lower PA.

As RT \npatients were excluded from participating in the pivotal studies of chimeric \nantigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T) for large B-cell lymphoma, there is \npaucity of information about the efficacy of CAR-T in RT. Therefore, through the \nCenter for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry, \nwe analyzed data from 140 RT patients who received anti-CD19 CAR-T between 2018 \nand 2023. Patients had received a median of 3 lines of therapy for RT \n(range:1-8), with nearly 43% being exposed to a Bruton's tyrosine kinase \ninhibitor and/or venetoclax.

Treatment for CxCa typically involves the systemic \nadministration of chemotherapeutic agents. However, these treatments often \nresult in fatigue, increased risk of infection, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, \nloss of appetite, and diarrhea. Therefore, it is crucial to explore new drugs \nand site-specific drug delivery strategies to combat cervical neoplasia. This \nstudy aimed to design vaginal suppositories based on chitosan-gelatin that \nenable mucoadhesion and the release of curcumin and gemcitabine and to evaluate \ntheir effects on HeLa cells. Gelatin-chitosan ovules loaded with curcumin and \ngemcitabine were successfully formulated. The uptake of simulated vaginal fluid \n(SVF) resulted in an increase in weight ranging from 40\u202f% to 80\u202f%. The ovules \nexhibited porosityand hydrophilicity and demonstrated mucoadhesive properties on \nporcine vaginal tissue. After 8\u202fh of incubation at 37\u202f\u00b0C, ovules containing 10\u202f% \ngelatin released more curcumin, while those with 10\u202f% and 20\u202f% released more \ngemcitabine. Curcumin and gemcitabine exhibited cytotoxic effects on HeLa cells, \nwith IC50 values of 13.47\u202f\u00b5M and 0.15\u202f\u00b5M, respectively. Furthermore, it was \nobserved that curcumin reversed gemcitabine-induced necrosis and promoted a \nmechanism like apoptosis or necroptosis.

In this study, we \ninvestigated the effects of different preservatives (benzyl alcohol, m-cresol, \nphenoxyethanol, and benzalkonium chloride) on the biophysical stability of \ntrastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody widely used for treatment of HER2 \nreceptor-positive cancers. Among the preservatives tested, benzyl alcohol (1.0\u202f% \nv/v) and m-cresol (0.3\u202f% w/v) significantly reduced the monomeric content after \n5\u202fdays of end-over-end agitation stress. Benzyl alcohol was associated with a \nsurge in nano- to micro-sized particles (21-fold increase) and decreased thermal \nstability (\u0394Tm: -5.39\u202f\u00b0C). m-Cresol uniquely triggered visible particle \nformation (>100\u202f\u00b5m) within 72\u202fh, raising concerns for injectable biologics. \nBenzalkonium chloride (0.01\u202f%-0.04\u202f% w/v) exhibited inconsistent \nconcentration-dependent behavior, initially showing increase in subvisible \naggregates before stabilizing through micelle formation at higher \nconcentrations, albeit with irreversible secondary structural shifts toward \n\u03b2-sheet motifs. Conversely, phenoxyethanol (0.5\u202f% v/v) exhibited higher \ncompatibility, preserved the monomeric content, and suppressed particle \ngeneration to baseline levels. These findings underscore the necessity of \npreservative-specific compatibility assessments in formulation design for \ntherapeutic biologics, positioning phenoxyethanol as a promising candidate for \ntrastuzumab preservation owing to the balance between its antimicrobial efficacy \nand minimal destabilization.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025.

The [ANONYMIZED STUDY NAME] trial aimed to \ncharacterize the molecular changes induced by preoperative RT across BC \nsubtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like.\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: This exploratory study enrolled 20 patients with \nearly-stage BC who were eligible for breast-conserving surgery and had not \nreceived prior treatment. Biological changes were assessed between baseline, 3-5 \ndays post-RT, and surgical samples. A preoperative RT boost (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.67 \nGy/fraction) was administered, followed by a core-needle biopsy. Patients then \nproceeded to either surgery 4 weeks (2-8 weeks) after RT or neoadjuvant therapy. \nGene expression was analyzed with a 192-gene panel, alongside \nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) for Ki67 and CD68, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes \n(TILs) quantification, and \u03b3H2AX staining for DNA damage assessment.\nRESULTS: At baseline, PAM50 subtype distribution was: Luminal A (35%), Luminal B \n(25%), HER2-enriched (20%), and Basal-like (20%). Early post-RT samples showed \nsignificant downregulation of proliferation genes, PAM50 proliferation signature \nand Ki67 IHC staining, increased DNA damage and macrophage marker upregulation. \nIn primary surgery samples (2-8 weeks post-RT) (n=13), adaptive immune markers \nshowed significant upregulation, along with a 14-gene immunoglobulin signature \nincrease.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative RT induces early and late biological changes in BC, \nwith initial effects on proliferation reduction and DNA damage within days, \nfollowed by adaptive immune activation within weeks. RT may serve as an \neffective primer for immunotherapy, especially in higher-risk subtypes, \nsupporting the potential for combinatorial approaches in BC management.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 The Authors.

The goal of this study is to demonstrate the \ncomparability in TURBT performance between supervised urology residents and \nattendings.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a subanalysis of a prospective, randomized \ntrial enrolling patients diagnosed with BC and undergoing endoscopic \nintervention. The trial (NCT04712201) was approved by the Institutional Review \nBoard (2017/09c). Surgeons were either urology attendings or supervised \nresidents of the 3rd-5th year. Primary outcome was to compare surgical and \npost-operative outcomes in both groups.\nRESULTS: From 04/2018 to 06/2021, 300 patients met inclusion criteria and 248 \n(83%) of these underwent the assigned intervention. 200 (80.6%) patients were \nmales and median (SD) age was 72.2 (11.2). No statistical differences were found \nin terms of intra and post-operative outcomes (all p\u2009>\u20090.05). Linear and \nlogistic regression analysis resulted comparable for all variables (all \np\u2009>\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSION: Supervised urology residents do not put the patient at an increased \nrisk of complications neither perform a suboptimal procedure.

The major \nchallenges in chemotherapy and radiotherapy for GC include drug resistance, \nsystemic toxicity, limited tumor selectivity, adverse side effects, tumor \nheterogeneity, and the development of radioresistance, all of which hinder \ntreatment efficacy and patient outcomes. Aptamers, single-stranded DNA or RNA \nmolecules with high specificity and affinity for molecular targets, offer a \npromising alternative to traditional diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Due \nto their high specificity and low immunogenicity, aptamers improve non-invasive \ndiagnostic techniques, enabling early GC detection and targeted therapeutic \napplications. Therapeutically, aptamers facilitate precise drug targeting, \nreducing systemic toxicity and improving treatment outcomes, especially for \ndrug-resistant and metastatic cases. Integration with nanotechnology further \nenhances their potential, enabling theranostic applications that combine \ndiagnosis and therapy. Despite these advancements, challenges such as \nphysiological stability, renal clearance, and tissue permeability remain, \nnecessitating further research into chemical modifications and nanocarrier-based \ndelivery systems. This study provides a comprehensive review of recent \nadvancements in aptamer technology and its evolving applications in GC, with a \nparticular emphasis on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The first section \nexplores aptamer development strategies, including emerging selection techniques \nand molecular modifications to enhance their specificity and stability. The \nsubsequent section examines the role of aptamers in GC diagnostics and \ntreatment, with a focus on targeted chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Lastly, we \ndiscuss the current challenges in aptamer-based approaches and outline future \nperspectives for their clinical translation.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, \ncircular RNA-targeted therapeutics have shown considerable promise in cancer \ntreatment; yet their application for breast cancer-bone metastases remain \ninfrequent. Comprehending the mechanisms underlying breast cancer-bone \nmetastasis could provide possible targets in the future.\nMETHODS: The biological characteristics of circRHBDD1(4,5) were validated via \nSanger sequencing, RNase R, and actinomycin D treatment, and its expression was \nfurther validated using in situ hybridization in breast cancer tissues. The \nimpact of circRHBDD1(4,5) in bone-metastatic niche formation and bone metastasis \nwas investigated utilizing osteoclastogenesis bone resorption pit assays and \nxenografted tumor models. Additionally, the mechanism underlying \ncircRHBDD1(4,5)-mediated CCL2 mRNA stability was investigated using RNA \npull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.\nRESULTS: CircRHBDD1(4,5) was significantly elevated (P\u202f<\u202f0.001) in bone-tropic \nmetastatic breast cancer cells and bone-metastatic breast cancer tissues, which \nsignificantly enhanced osteoclastogenesis and induced the formation of bone \nmetastatic niches by upregulating the chemokine CCL2. Mechanistically, \ncircRHBDD1(4,5) directly interacted with CCL2 mRNA, whose expression was \nsignificantly positively correlated with immune cell infiltration and breast \ncancer-bone metastasis, and increased its stability and translation by \nrecruiting the RNA-binding protein ELAVL1. Finally, treatment with locked \nnucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotides, which targeted circRHBDD1(4,5) on CCL2 mRNA \nbinding sites, namely LNA-based CMI-blockers, effectively inhibited \ncircRHBDD1(4,5)-induced osteoclastogenesis and breast cancer-bone metastasis.\nCONCLUSION: We revealed a credible mechanism for circRHBDD1(4,5)-induced breast \ncancer-bone metastasis and hypothesized that disrupting circRHBDD1(4,5)-CCL2 \nmRNA interactions could be a promising strategy for treating breast cancer bone \nmetastases.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025.

In our previous study, we found that a novel flavonoid, Japoflavone \nB (JFB), exhibited an excellent activity in vitro against the growth of cancer \ncells. However, the in vivo activity and molecular mechanism still need further \nresearch. Herein, JFB could particularly inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC \ncells, but not normal lung epithelial cells. Consistently, JFB induced \ninflammatory pyroptosis through the activation of Caspase-3 and GSDME, and \ntriggered mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by activation of Caspases-3/7/9. \nMoreover, JFB could inhibit PARP1 activity, and promote DNA damage and ROS \naccumulation. Meanwhile, JFB was able to considerably promote p-p38 and p53 \nexpression. Furthermore, the expression patterns of cyclins, CDKs, and CKIs was \nreprogrammed to induce cell cycle G2/M arrest with JFB treatment. In vivo, JFB \nexhibited a comparable anti-tumor activity to Dox with no significant tissue \ntoxicity.

We hypothesized that PD-1 depletion in \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) TIL-derived T cells would enhance their \nanti-tumor efficacy.\nMETHODS: CRISPR/ Cas9 system was employed to target PDCD1 in HCC TIL-derived T \ncells. The phenotypic and functional changes were analyzed by flow cytometry. \nT-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and bulk RNA-sequencing of PD-1-edited or \nnon-edited T cells was conducted to examine their differences. Finally, we \ndemonstrated the ability of PD-1-edited or non-edited T cells to inhibit tumor \ngrowth in HCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.\nRESULTS: CRISPR/Cas9 system was demonstrated to provide an effective and stable \nPD-1-editing efficiency. The phenotypes, effector and memory subpopulations of \nthe PD-1-edited T cells were found to have maintained stability, while they did \nacquire higher potential in terms of autologous tumor cell elimination. Compared \nto their counterpart, PD-1-edited T cells also retained a higher level of \nhomology with the whole and tumor-specific TCR clonotypes of primary HCC TILs. \nFurthermore, PD-1-edited T cells exhibited a superior anti-tumor response \ncompared with non-edited T cells in HCC PDX models.\nCONCLUSION: Taken together, our results have provided a foundation for the \nclinical application of ACT based on genetically modified TIL, offering a new \nperspective on exploring clinical immunotherapy strategies for HCC, and \npotentially other solid tumors.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025.

ABCA4 has been identified as an oncogene in \nmultiple malignancies, but its specific mechanisms in LUAD remain poorly \nunderstood. This study aims to explore the function of ABCA4 in LUAD with a \nfocus on mitophagy.\nMETHODS: ABCA4 expression in LUAD was evaluated using the TCGA database, western \nblotting, RT-qPCR, and immunohistochemistry. The effects of ABCA4 knockdown on \nLUAD progression were examined in vitro (CCK8, Muse\u00ae Cell Analyzer, Transwell), \nand in vivo through (xenogeneic tumor experiments). Mitophagy was assessed by \nJC-1, TMRE, and DCFH-DA staining, the Muse Oxidative Stress Kit, transmission \nelectron microscopy, and western blotting.

RNA-seq identified differentially expressed genes \n(DEGs) after siABCA4 treatment, and the effects of ABCA4 on LUAD by modulating \nTMSB4X were explored.\nRESULTS: ABCA4 was up-regulated in the TCGA database, LUAD tissues, and cell \nlines. ABCA4 knockdown inhibited proliferation and tumor growth while promoting \napoptosis and mitophagy. Mechanistically, siABCA4 increased AMPK phosphorylation \nlevels. CQ or S7306 partially reversed these biological effects. Additionally, \nABCA4 may interact with TMSB4X to regulate mitophagy via the AMPK pathway, \nthereby influencing LUAD progression.\nCONCLUSIONS: ABCA4 was overexpressed in LUAD, and its knockdown might promote \nmitophagy in LUAD progression via the AMPK pathway by modulating TMSB4X, \nsuggesting that ABCA4 could serve as a therapeutic target for LUAD patients.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 Elsevier B.V.

Our primary objective was to assess \noverall survival (OS) in a real-world cohort of advanced MCC patients treated \nwith PD(L)1 inhibitors in France. Secondary objectives were to assess real-world \noverall response rates (rwORR), duration of response (rwDOR), progression-free \nsurvival (rwPFS) and predictive factors of response.\nMETHODS: Patients from an ongoing cohort of MCC cases (1998-2023) were included \nin the current study if they had received at least one infusion of PD-1/PD-L1 \ninhibitor for advanced MCC as any line of treatment.\nRESULTS: Among the 81 patients included, OS at 24\u202fmonths- was 58\u202f% (95\u202f% \nconfidence interval (CI) 46.2-68.9). RwORR was 51.9\u202f% (95\u202f%CI 40.9-62.9).

Patients with a history of \nradiation, recurrence, neoadjuvant chemotherapy or positive margins were \nexcluded. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival \n(DFS). Secondary outcomes were factors associated with recurrence, \nradiation-induced toxicity, and quality of life.\nRESULTS: 1260 OSCC were operated during the study period. 357(28\u00a0%) were early \nstage, and 274 were eligible for analysis. 52(18.9\u00a0%) patients had recurrence. \n3-year-OS was 92\u00a0% and 3-year-DFS was 74\u00a0%.

To support the \nevaluation of the impact of new drug therapies on QoL in single-arm studies in \nadenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), we sought to determine the QoL baseline in a \ncohort of patients with ACC during routine follow up visits and to assess for \nassociations with clinical or prognostic factors.\nMETHODS: An internationally-validated QoL questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) was completed \nby patients with ACC referred to an experimental medicine centre. EQ-5D value \nscores (EQV) were calculated from each questionnaire using the EuroQol England \nvalue set. A Cox proportional hazards model was built with EQV as a \ntime-dependent variable. Non-linear mixed effects modelling (NLME) was used to \ntest the relationship between EQV and predictors (time, NOTCH1 status, age at \ndiagnosis, sex, local and/or metastatic recurrence, and primary site of \ndisease).\nRESULTS: Between 2019 and 2023, 563 questionnaires were completed by 161 \npatients with ACC. Median EQV was 0.81 (range -0.22 to 1.0) and mean EQV was \n0.79. A decrease in EQV from 1 to 0 was associated with an eightfold increase in \nrisk of death in the total population (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.118, 95\u00a0% CI 0.057 to 0.244, \np=<0.001).

Most lesions can be treated with same-day \nexamination and simple surgery, while more complex cases require advanced \nprocedures and a separate pre-surgical visit. However, referral letters often \nfail to convey case complexity accurately, resulting in unnecessary hospital \nsurgical planning visits for cases that ultimately require only simple \nprocedures. Efficient triaging is essential to direct patients to the \nappropriate treatment pathway. This study evaluates whether patient-submitted \nphotographs can improve the efficiency and accuracy of surgical planning for \nnon-melanoma skin cancer in a prospective cohort study. Patients were invited to \nsubmit photographs and complete a simple survey using the mobile application \n'Mit Sygehus'. Data were extracted from electronic medical records and used to \nanalyze triage patterns during a six-month baseline period, response rates to \nthe study invitation over an 18-month study period, and differences between \nresponders and non-responders using appropriate statistical tests. In the \nbaseline group, 116 patients were triaged for surgical planning but ultimately \nunderwent minor procedures without reconstructive surgery, suggesting they could \nhave benefited from photo-assisted triage. In the study group, 201 patients were \neligible for photo-assisted triage, as it was not clear from the referral \nletters which treatment would be appropiate. We had 95 patients responding to \nthe invitation with 50 of these triaged directly to surgical treatment. \nResponders had shorter wait times to treatment compared to non-responders.

Clock genes, which regulate circadian rhythms, are linked to tumor \noccurrence, progression, and treatment responses, and are often abnormally \nexpressed in many tumors. Ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death, plays \na role in tumor drug resistance. Recent research indicates that clock genes may \ninfluence tumor cells' sensitivity to ferroptosis by regulating cellular \nmetabolism and oxidative stress responses. Through bioinformatics analysis, we \nidentified the clock gene ARNTL2 as a key factor associated with \nchemoresistance. ARNTL2 was found to be significantly overexpressed in colon \ncancer, and was closely correlated with poor prognosis. Experimental validation \nusing in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated that ARNTL2 promotes resistance \nto 5-FU by upregulating SLC7A11, a critical regulator of ferroptosis. \nMechanistically, ARNTL2 directly binds to the SLC7A11 promoter and enhances its \ntranscription, while also influencing SLC7A11 mRNA stability through PHGDH. \nThese findings establish the ARNTL2-SLC7A11 axis as an important mechanism \ndriving ferroptosis resistance and chemoresistance in colon cancer. Furthermore, \nwe explored the therapeutic potential of melatonin (Mlt), a circadian-regulating \nhormone, and discovered that Mlt can degrade ARNTL2 via the \nubiquitination-proteasome pathway, thereby downregulating the ARNTL2-SLC7A11 \naxis. Our results highlight ARNTL2 as a promising biomarker for predicting \nchemoresistance and prognosis in colon cancer patients. Additionally, the \nability of Mlt to enhance chemotherapy sensitivity by targeting the \nARNTL2-SLC7A11 axis offers a novel, low-toxicity strategy for improving \ntreatment outcomes.

The primary outcome \nwas postoperative LT4 therapy. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression \nevaluated the relationship between covariates and LT4 therapy. Covariates \nselected by lasso regression as significantly associated with LT4 therapy were \nincorporated into a weighted risk score. Performance characteristics for the \nrisk score were assessed.\nRESULTS: Of 425 patients, the median preoperative TSH was 1.4 uIU/mL \ninterquartile range: 0.9-2.0), and 101 patients (23.8%) had a diagnosis of \nhypothyroidism. In total, 41.9% (n = 178) of patients required LT4 supplement \nafter partial thyroidectomy.

The \nprognosis for RAAS is poorly understood, and surgical outcomes are often \nunsatisfactory. Our group investigated the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy \n(NAC) on RAAS. This study aims to refine prognostic factors and assess the \neffect of NAC on breast RAAS.\nMETHODS: We analyzed M0 patients who underwent surgery for breast RAAS. \nPrognostic factors for overall survival (OS), time to distant progression \n(TTDP), and time to loco-regional progression (TTLP) were identified. Outcomes \nin patients receiving surgery alone (S) were compared to those receiving NAC \nfollowed by surgery (NAC\u00a0+\u00a0S) using Cox regression. Results were further \nvalidated through a propensity score model.\nRESULTS: Out of 180 patients (179 women), 141 received S, and 39 received \nNAC\u00a0+\u00a0S. Median follow-up was 5.5 years. The 5-year OS rate was 50\u00a0%. Local \nrecurrence occurred twice as often as metastases, with TTLP and TTDP rates of \n68\u00a0% and 36\u00a0%, respectively.

It \nleads to symptomatic improvement but as with any medication carries risks, as \noutlined in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labels.\nAIM: The current study analyzes TT lawsuits against providers to identify \nlitigation patterns, adverse outcomes, and their implications, informing \nclinical practices for improved patient safety and reduced legal risk.\nMETHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of the Westlaw and LexisNexis legal \ndatabases, covering cases from 2000 to 2024, using the keywords \"testosterone\" \ncombined with \"MD,\" \"DO,\" or \"Dr.\" We identified cases, excluding those against \n\"Commissioner of Social Security\" or \", Inc.\" entities, to narrow the focus to \nindividual healthcare providers. A total of 306 cases from Westlaw and 683 from \nLexisNexis were reviewed. After applying the inclusion criteria, 25 cases were \nselected for final analysis, with data extracted on treatment type, adverse \noutcomes, provider specialty, and court rulings.\nOUTCOMES: We sought to characterize common provider specialties, treatment \npatterns, adverse outcomes, and legal decisions associated with TT-related \nlitigation.\nRESULTS: Among the 25 cases involving TT, most involved internal medicine \nproviders (12 cases, 48%), followed by family medicine (4 cases, 16%) and \nurology (2 cases, 8%). There were 3 cases from 2000 to 2010 and 22 cases from \n2011 to 2023. The primary harms included withholding TT (10 cases, 40%), \nprostate cancer (4 cases, 16%), death (3 cases, 12%), cardiac events (3 cases, \n12%), psychiatric effects (2 cases, 8%), and less frequent adverse outcomes, \neach observed in 1 case (4%), included virilization in female patients and \ninfections or abscesses. Gels (6 cases, 24%) and testosterone injections (5 \ncases, 20%) were the most frequently involved treatments. Court rulings favored \ndefendants in 9 cases (36%) and plaintiffs in 3 cases (12%). Nine cases (36%) \nwere related to violations of the Eighth Amendment in incarcerated individuals. \nSeven cases (28%) remain unresolved.\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Litigation related to TT often centers on nontreatment \nand oncologic complications, underscoring the need for guideline-concordant \nprescribing and thorough risk communication.\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The strengths of this study include a two-decade \nreview and focus on provider-level litigation patterns. Limitations include \nexclusion of settled or sealed cases, and absence of financial data or patient \ndemographics. The small sample size may also limit generalizability.\nCONCLUSION: TT-related lawsuits are increasing, particularly among \nnonurologists, highlighting the importance of documentation, risk \nstratification, and communication to reduce legal exposure and improve patient \ncare.", "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is the most \ncommonly performed procedure, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa \n(MENA) region. It involves resection of approximately 80% of the stomach, \nyielding large specimens for histopathological evaluation.\nOBJECTIVES: To identify histopathological findings in gastric specimens, \nevaluate the incidence of unexpected gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), \nand characterize the metabolic and bariatric surgery population in Saudi Arabia.\nDESIGN: Retrospective cohort.\nSETTINGS: Single-center tertiary care in Saudi Arabia.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included patients who underwent laparoscopic \ngastric sleeve between May 2015 and April 2021. Inclusion criteria were patients \nwith BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2 who underwent surgery as treatment for obesity.\nMAIN OUTCO ME MEASURES: Gastric histopathological findings, unexpected GIST \nincidence and metabolic and bariatric surgery population.\nSAMPLE SIZE: 211 patients with obesity.\nRESULTS: Patients' mean age was 38.2 years with a mean Body mass index (BMI) of \n44.24 kg/m2. The majority were females (60.2%). Normal histology findings \naccounted for 43.1% of findings, followed by chronic inactive gastritis (35.5%). \nIntestinal metaplasia was found in 1 (0.5%) patient while incidental GIST was \nfound in 2 (0.9%) patients. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was identified in \n12.8% of cases, with a mean patient age of 36.7 years. Among H. pylori-positive \npatients, 48% presented with chronic active gastritis, 33% with chronic inactive \ngastritis, 14.8% with active follicular gastritis, and 3.7% with inactive \nfollicular gastritis. A history of prior endoscopy was noted in 16.1% of \npatients, of whom 11.76% were found to have H. pylori postoperatively.\nCONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection was detected at a mean age of 36.7 years and \nshowed a significant association with higher BMI (mean difference: 2.2 kg/m2, \nP=.04). While this suggests a potential link between obesity and H. pylori \nsusceptibility, the clinical significance of this small absolute difference \nrequires further investigation.

Invasiveness and proliferation of FLS in RA is dependent on \nactivity of the KCa1.1 potassium channel. Peptide blockers of KCa1.1, such as \niberiotoxin (IbTX), can be delivered subcutaneously to treat animal models of \nRA. We tested whether an engineered probiotic oral delivery platform could \neffectively deliver IbTX systemically in a rat model of RA.\nRESULTS: A plasmid for inducible secretion of IbTX was constructed and \ntransformed into probiotic Limosilactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA-6475 to generate \nLrIbTX. No differences in growth rate between LrIbTX and the control strain were \ndetected in vitro, and live LrIbTX was recovered from the feces of rats \nfollowing oral gavage. IbTX was detected in the sera of healthy rats orally \ngavaged with LrIbTX by a KCa1.1 competitive binding assay using a biotinylated \nIbTX analog and streptavidin-conjugated fluorophore. Collagen-induced arthritis \n(CIA), an animal model of RA, was used to measure the effect of LrIbTX versus \ninjected IbTX or control L. reuteri expressing an irrelevant protein on clinical \nscore, histologic inflammation, and bone density. Oral LrIbTX and injected IbTX \nhad similar efficacy in treating CIA in rats as measured by clinical joint \nswelling and histologic inflammation, which were significantly improved versus \ncontrol bacteria or vehicle injection. No treatments induced measurable levels \nof anti-IbTX IgG, and there were no differences in macroscopic bone damage or \nanti-collagen II IgM and IgG levels between CIA groups. Injected IbTX and oral \nLrIbTX were also equivalent in inhibiting an active delayed-type \nhypersensitivity (DTH) reaction in rats.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work describes the effective oral delivery of a candidate \ntherapeutic peptide, IbTX, via engineered L. reuteri to treat an animal model of \nautoimmune disease and demonstrates systemic distribution of an intestinally \nproduced peptide.

Thematic analysis was conducted by coding and organizing the \ntranscribed texts to identify emerging themes and sub-themes. Findings revealed \nthat key institutional management factors promoting compliance with the NCTGs at \nORCI include the existence of a well-defined policy on guidelines utilization, a \nsupportive working environment, and a well-established support system. \nConversely, a significant barrier identified was the low healthcare \nprovider-to-patient ratio and machine downtime. The study found that strong \ninstitutional management characterized by clear policies, a supportive work \nenvironment, and effective support systems facilitates adherence to the NCTGs at \nORCI. Nonetheless, the shortage of healthcare personnel poses a major challenge. \nTherefore, it is essential for the Ministry of Health, in collaboration with \nORCI management, to recruit additional oncologists, surgeons, and other critical \nhealthcare professionals.

Demographics, tumor characteristics, metastasis patterns, surgical \ninterventions, and systemic treatments were recorded. Survival outcomes were \nanalyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model. \nFactors such as MSKCC and IMDC risk scores, the number and location of \nmetastases, and treatment modalities were evaluated for their prognostic impact.\nRESULTS: Forty-two patients with a mean age of 58.4 years and a mean follow-up \nperiod of 28.4 months were included in the study. The 1-, 2-, and 5-year overall \nsurvival (OS) rates were 73.7%, 44.2%, and 13.7%, respectively. Solitary \nmetastases (5-year OS 80%) and complete metastasectomy (5-year OS 20.1%) were \nassociated with significantly improved survival. Diffuse metastases (HR 22.8; \np\u2009=\u20090.006) and oligometastases (HR 7.7; p\u2009=\u20090.044) were associated with higher \nmortality compared to solitary lesions. Neither MSKCC nor IMDC scores were \nindependently predictive of OS in multivariate analysis. Systemic therapies, \nincluding tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), mTOR inhibitors, antiresorptive \nagents, and radiotherapy, did not significantly impact survival outcomes.\nCONCLUSION: This study emphasizes that metastatic burden and achieving complete \nmetastasectomy are the most critical factors for prolonged survival in \nmetastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) with bone involvement.

By integrating multi-omics \nresults we identified a novel mechanism in which bone-derived type-I collagen \n(Col1a1) and fibronectin (Fn1) stimulate SPP1 expression in PCa cells through \nthe activation of PKA signaling. This bone-induced regulation of SPP1 was \nconfirmed both in vitro, using PCa-bone co-culture systems (PC3 or C42B/MC3T3 \ncell lines), and in vivo, using cell lines' engraftments and patient-derived \nxenografts (PDX) grown intrafemorally. Importantly, clinical data from \nlongitudinal patient samples revealed that treatment with enzalutamide, an \nandrogen receptor (AR) inhibitor, led to an increase in PKA signaling and \ncorresponding SPP1 expression in a subpopulation of patients, highlighting the \nrelevance of the PKA/SPP1 axis in disease progression under AR-targeted \ntherapies.

A change in \npreference was tested from an assumed low change rate of 5% to a rate of \u226515%, \nwith a one-sided 5% level binomial test.\nRESULTS: Seventy-five women enrolled. Adverse events attributed to pre-ET \noccurred in 35 participants (47%).

EGLN1, a protein belonging to the family of \nprolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins, has been associated with the \nprogression of various cancer types. However, its involvement in CRC remains \nuncertain.\nMETHODS: We conducted an analysis of EGLN1 expression levels in colorectal \ncancer (CRC) tissues using publicly available datasets. EGLN1 expression was \nalso evaluated in relation to patient survival. To explore the potential \nbiological functions and signaling pathways associated with EGLN, we performed \ngene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We also investigated the immune landscape \nof EGLN1 in CRC by examining its association with immune infiltration and \nimmune-related markers.\nRESULTS: We consistently observed a significant decrease in EGLN1 level in CRC \ntumor tissues when compared to normal tissues, indicating its potential role as \na tumor suppressor gene specific to CRC. The diagnostic potential of EGLN1 was \nsubstantiated by its effective discrimination between normal and tumor tissues \nin patients with CRC. Functional enrichment analysis further uncovered EGLN1's \ninvolvement in the regulation of crucial biological processes, cellular \ncomponents, and molecular functions relevant to CRC development and progression. \nThe correlation analysis revealed the potential immunomodulatory role of EGLN1, \naffecting immune checkpoint molecules, antigen presentation, and immune cell \ntrafficking within the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, high level of EGLN1 \nexhibited a significant association with improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) \nand emerged as an independent prognostic factor. Knockdown experiments \ndemonstrated EGLN1's role in suppressing cell proliferation and migration in \nCRC.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, our findings position EGLN1 as a promising multi-faceted \nbiomarker in CRC, with implications for prognosis, immune microenvironment \nmodulation, and potential therapeutic targeting.", "\u00a9 2025.

This study assessed whether premedication with dexamethasone \nreduces the incidence of IRs associated with HER2-targeted therapy.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, multicenter trial, 100 patients with HER2-positive \nearly breast cancer were randomized to receive dexamethasone either before \n(experimental group) or after (control group) HER2-targeted agents. All patients \nreceived trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel. The primary endpoint was the \nincidence of IRs during the first treatment cycle. Secondary endpoints included \nthe incidence of grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 IRs, IRs in cycle 2, and overall adverse events.\nRESULTS: Incidence of IRs in cycle 1 was significantly lower in the experimental \ngroup (24.0%) than in the control group (60.0%) (P\u2009<\u20090.001), corresponding to an \nabsolute risk reduction of 36.0%. No grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 IRs occurred in either group. The \nincidence of IRs during cycle 2 was low and similar between groups (8.0% vs. \n10.2%; P\u2009=\u20090.703). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was similar \nbetween groups (98.0% vs. 100.0%, P\u2009>\u20090.999). Time-course analysis revealed that \nmost of IRs in the control group occurred before dexamethasone administration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Premedication with dexamethasone before HER2-targeted therapy \nsubstantially reduced IRs without additional toxicity. This straightforward, \ncost-effective modification to the premedication protocol may improve \ntolerability in HER2-positive breast cancer and other antibody-based therapies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000045181 (registered on August 18, 2021).", "\u00a9 2025.

Therefore, this study \naimed to analyze the risk of heart-specific death (HSD) in patients with BC by \nusing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The \neligible patients diagnosed with BC between 2000 and 2019 were exported from the \nSEER database. The standard mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated to compare \nthe difference in HSD between patients with BC and the general population. The \nCox Proportional hazard model was used to estimate the risk factors for HSD in \nBC patients and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Overall, \n655,552 eligible patients were included in our study, and 149,708 (22.8%) \npatients died. Among the deaths, 22,718 (15.2%) cases were attributed HD which \nwas the second cause of death for BC patients. With the extension of follow-up \n(>\u200910 years), HD surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of death for BC \n(22.3% vs. 20.2%). The SMR for HD was 8.14 (95%CI: 8.04-8.25) in the whole \ncohort. Multivariate analysis showed that race, age, marital status, median \nhousehold income, grade, stage and subtype were independent risk factors for HSD \nin BC patients.

However, evidence \non structured exercise prehabilitation, specifically for functional recovery \nafter esophagectomy, remains limited. Hence, this pilot study aimed to examine \nthe feasibility and safety of a one-week exercise prehabilitation protocol and \nto explore its preliminary effects on functional capacity in patients with \nesophageal cancer undergoing surgery.\nMETHODS: This is a parallel-group, randomized, open-label, pragmatic pilot \ntrial. Patients with esophageal cancer awaiting surgery were randomly assigned \nto either the prehabilitation group or the control group. The prehabilitation \ngroup received a one-week structured exercise prehabilitation program that \nincluded respiratory, resistance and aerobic exercise before surgery, whereas \nthe control group received no preoperative intervention. Feasibility was \nevaluated by the eligibility rate, recruitment rate, follow-up assessment rate, \nand exercise adherence rate. Safety was assessed by monitoring and recording any \nserious adverse events that occurred during the exercise program. Preliminary \nefficacy was determined via changes in functional capacity, postoperative \ncomplications, and quality of life.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one patients were randomized, and 16 were included in the \nprimary analysis. Prehabilitation is feasible, with a recognized eligibility \nrate (69%), recruitment rate (95%) and follow-up completion rate (76%). All \n(100%) participants attended each treatment session during the prehabilitation \nand postoperative rehabilitation phases. No serious adverse events were \nreported. A statistically significant improvement in the change in the 6-minute \nwalking distance from baseline was found in the prehabilitation group after one \nweek of prehabilitation intervention compared with the control group \n(P\u2009<\u20090.001). A significant interaction effect (group \u00d7 time) was also observed \n(P\u2009=\u20090.011). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of \npostoperative complications between the groups. Prehabilitation also potentially \nimproved the preoperative quality of life (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The one-week structured exercise prehabilitation protocol is \nfeasible and safe for esophagectomy patients and has the potential to enhance \npreoperative functional capacity and quality of life. These findings support \nfurther investigations in large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate \nthe efficacy for clinical endpoints.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was retrospectively registered with the Chinese \nClinical Trial Registry on 25/09/2024 (ChiCTR2400090172).", "\u00a9 2025.

Medical and \nsurgical intensive care units (ICUs) have various characteristics. Studies on \nwhether mandatory CEC have different impacts on medical and surgical ICUs are \nlimited. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of mandatory CEC on \nresource use and ethical conflicts as well as family member satisfaction \nregarding critically ill patients in medical and surgical ICUs and their \npredicting factors.\nRESULTS: This combined retrospective and prospective cohort study was conducted \nat a tertiary academic university-affiliated medical center. Patients admitted \nto the adult ICUs and had CEC between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2020, \nwere eligible. A total of 1,150 adult patients were included, with 822 in the \nmedical and 328 in the surgical ICU. After the implementation of mandatory CEC \npolicy, resource use in both ICUs deceased biannually. Medical ICU has \nsignificantly longer total\u00a0length of stay (LOS), days of ventilator use, and \ndays from ICU admission to ethics consultation than surgical ICU. Advanced \ncancer and the episode of cardiac arrest mainly predicted ICU LOS and resource \nuse in the medical ICU, whereas the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was the main \npredicting factor for surgical ICU. Secular trends for incidence rates of \nethical conflicts decreased biannually in both ICUs. In general, higher \nincidence rates of ethical conflicts were observed in the surgical ICU. The \npredicting factors for ethical conflicts in the medical ICU included age, \npatients with advanced cancer, patients who received inotropes or vasopressors, \nand the GCS score, whereas in the surgical ICU, the marital status and GCS score \nwere the main predicting factors. Family members in both ICUs were highly \nsatisfied with the CEC team.\nCONCLUSION: Medical and surgical ICUs exhibited different impacts on resource \nuse and ethical conflicts after the implementation of mandatory CEC policy. Our \nresults provide CEC and clinical teams with guidelines to approach the distinct \nissues within various specialties. The institution should consider implementing \nmandatory CEC policy and developing special educational and training programs \nfor various specialties to provide the best quality of end-of-life care in the \nICUs.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier is NCT04926610.", "\u00a9 2025.

However, managing \nthese cases can be complex, especially when treatments such as chemotherapy lead \nto complications such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, which carries a \nsignificant risk of severe illness and death.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 55-year-old Arab woman diagnosed \nwith a rapidly growing triple-negative breast cancer, found to have a \nBRCA1/BRCA2 mutation. She began neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but the treatment was \nstopped early due to severe liver inflammation (transaminitis) and a sharp \nincrease in hepatitis B virus levels, confirming hepatitis B virus reactivation. \nAntiviral therapy with entecavir was promptly started. Later, the patient \ndeveloped rectal bleeding, leading to the diagnosis of a mid-rectal invasive \nadenocarcinoma. She underwent successful surgeries for both cancers: a right \nmodified radical mastectomy and a rectal resection with colostomy. Pathology \nconfirmed two distinct primary tumors. Despite initial concerns due to a \npositron emission tomography scan, subsequent biopsies showed no recurrence. The \npatient completed adjuvant radiation and, at a 3-year follow-up, remains healthy \nand disease-free.\nCONCLUSION: This case highlights the intricate challenges of managing \nsynchronous primary cancers and the life-threatening risk of hepatitis B virus \nreactivation during chemotherapy. It strongly emphasizes the need for routine \nhepatitis B virus screening before chemotherapy, careful monitoring of liver \nfunction and viral loads, and the immediate availability of antiviral treatment. \nA collaborative, multidisciplinary approach is essential for prioritizing \ntreatments effectively and achieving good outcomes in patients with such complex \ncancer presentations.", "\u00a9 2025.

The prostates, \nbladder, rectum, and femoral heads of 10 patients were automatically contoured \nbased on DirectORGANS algorithm at the CT simulator. On the same CT image sets, \nthe same target volumes and contours of organs at risk were manually contoured \nby an experienced physician using MRI images and used as a reference structure. \nThe doses of manually delineated contours of the target volume and organs at \nrisk and the doses of auto contours of the target volume and organs at risk were \nobtained from the dose volume histogram of the same plan.

In \ncritical organ structures, V60, V65, V70 for the rectum, V65, V70, V75, and V80 \nfor the bladder, and maximum doses for femoral heads were evaluated. The \nMann-Whitney U test was used for statistical comparison with statistical package \nSPSS (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nRESULTS: Compared to the doses of the manual contours (MC) with auto contours \n(AC), there was no significant difference between the doses of the organs at \nrisk.

To handle this longitudinal data, \nweighted logistic mixed effect models examined associations between cognitive \ndomain performance (predictor) and functional outcomes (IADL item level scores).\nRESULTS: In the total sample, poorer motor performance was associated with \nimpairments in home repairs, housekeeping, and laundry and poorer executive \nfunctioning was associated with impairment in planning social activities. Among \nolder virally suppressed-WWH, poorer motor performance was associated with \ndeficits in home repair and poorer executive performance was associated with \ndeficits in planning social activities.\nCONCLUSION: Since motor and executive performance were related to impairments in \ncertain IADLs, strategies such as cognitive training targeting these domains \ncould improve everyday functioning.

The \ncollected data were entered and cleaned using EpiData 4.6 and exported to SPSS \nversion 25 for analysis. Binary and multiple logistic regression analyses were \nperformed to identify factors associated with the outcome variable. In the \nmultivariate analysis, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval \n(CI) were used as measures of association, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was \nconsidered statistically significant for unmet supportive care needs.\nRESULTS: A total of 260 individuals were initially approached to participate, \nyielding a response rate of 93.1%.

Whilst methods exist to overcome issues such as \nnon-independence of repeated measurements and informative dropout, it is unclear \nhow often these are implemented in practice. The aim of this scoping review was \nto comprehensively describe the statistical methods used to analyse longitudinal \nquality of life scores derived from the QLQ-C30 questionnaire.\nMETHODS: Two databases, MEDLINE and Embase, were searched for randomised \ncontrolled trials and prospective observational studies presenting statistical \nanalyses of QLQ-C30 scores collected over time. Only studies published in \nEnglish between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2022 were included. Studies not \nreporting the statistical methods used were excluded. A REDCap database was \ndeveloped to store extracted information and results are presented as \ndescriptive summaries.\nRESULTS: Two-hundred and seventy-one eligible studies were identified including \n161 parallel group randomised controlled trials and 84 cohort studies.

Identifying modifiable psychosocial factors related to CRCI is \ncritical in devising targeted non-pharmacological interventions. We aimed to \ninvestigate the psychosocial factors associated with perceived cognitive \nfunctioning in prostate cancer survivors (PCS).\nMETHODS: Adult PCS, either undergoing hormone therapy or on 'watchful waiting'/ \n'active surveillance', were recruited for a cross-sectional survey. Perceived \ncognitive functioning was measured using the Perceived Cognitive Impairments \nsubscale (PCI20) from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-\u00a0Cognitive \nFunction questionnaire. Pearson's correlations and ANOVAs explored the \nassociation between PCI20 and psychosocial factors including psychological \ndistress, interpersonal functioning, functional well-being, self-compassion and \nintellectual engagement. Significant variables were included as predictors in a \nhierarchical regression, examining the relationship with PCI20 and related \npsychosocial factors while controlling for demographic, biomedical and lifestyle \nfactors.\nRESULTS: Of the 96 respondents, one-third reported low cognitive function. \nBetter perceived cognitive functioning was associated with better physical \nwell-being and functional well-being and lower depression levels. In a \nregression analysis with depression, physical and functional well-being as \npredictors, only functional well-being was a significant predictor of perceived \ncognitive functioning after controlling for cancer treatment and levels of \nphysical activity.\nCONCLUSION: Perceived cognitive functioning was associated with self-reported \nquality of life and the ability to participate in day-to-day activities \nincluding work and enjoyment.

The self-made \ngeneral information questionnaire, Family Resilience Questionnaire (FaRE), \nPittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Herth Hope Scale (HHI) were used to \ninvestigate their family resilience, sleep quality, and hope level. At the same \ntime, the Spearman correlation was used to analyze the relationship between \nfamily resilience, sleep quality, and hope level. The mediating role of family \nresilience on sleep and hope was analyzed using stepwise regression and \nvalidated with the bootstrap method.\nRESULT: Finally, 185 valid questionnaires were collected. The FaRE score of 185 \npatients after modified radical mastectomy was (101.32\u2009\u00b1\u200917.98), the PSQI score \nwas (7.58\u2009\u00b1\u20092.03), and the HHI score was (35.30\u2009\u00b1\u20095.43).

Natural \nsubstances have become a foremost source of bioactive molecules with intriguing \ncytotoxic effects, particularly those originating from microbes. The cytotoxic \npotential of pigments derived from the halophilic bacteria Kushneria avicenniae \nHA346018, which was isolated from mangrove environments, is investigated in this \nwork. These pigments' cytotoxic, apoptotic, and cell cycle-modulating properties \nwere assessed in human HepG2 and MCF-7 cell lines. Both cancer cell lines \nrevealed a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability, indicating the pigment \nextract's potent cytotoxic effects in vitro. HepG2 and MCF-7 cells have computed \nIC50 values of 52.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8\u00a0\u00b5g/mL and 48.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, respectively. Its notable \nselective cytotoxicity highlighted the pigment's potential as a targeted \ntherapy, which revealed much less toxicity against normal WI-38 cells. A notable \nconcentration of cells in the G2/M phase and a considerable change in cell cycle \nprogression were seen by flow cytometric analysis, indicating the extract's \npotential to cause cell cycle arrest. The regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases \n(CDKs) and DNA damage response pathways was associated with this inhibition at \nthe G2/M checkpoint. Moreover, Annexin V-FITC/PI labeling and subsequent flow \ncytometric analysis verified that the pigment caused both early and late \napoptotic events. The mitochondrial mechanisms that mediated the apoptosis were \nthe elevation of pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax and the downregulation of \nanti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2, which eventually led to caspase activation. \nThese results establish Kushneria avicenniae pigments as a viable source of \nbioactive chemicals with therapeutic potential for breast and liver malignancies \nby offering new mechanistic insights into their apoptosis-inducing effect in \ncancer cell lines.

We first investigated the association between mSEPT9 status and \nclinicopathological characteristics in the overall CRC cohort. Subsequently, in \na subset of 479 stage IV CRC patients receiving systemic antitumor therapy, we \nevaluated the predictive value of mSEPT9 status by assessing treatment outcomes, \nincluding objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS).\nFINDINGS: mSEPT9 positivity was significantly elevated in stage \u2163 versus stage \n\u2160-\u2162 patients and correlated with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) \nscore, but not with other clinicopathological features. mSEPT9-positive patients \ndemonstrated significantly higher ORR to fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, and \nbevacizumab compared with mSEPT9-negative patients, whereas no significant ORR \ndifferences were observed for irinotecan or cetuximab.

An \nappropriate diagnosis enables optimal symptom correction, reduces the risk of \nfalls, and improves quality of life.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Following a concise overview of the anatomy, physiology, \nand principles of vestibular exploration, a narrative review of the primary \nvestibulopathies encountered in cancer patients is conducted. This review \ndetails their exploration and the anti-cancer treatments responsible for \nvestibular ototoxicity.\nKEY FINDINGS: Vestibular ototoxicity from systemic treatments typically presents \nas chronic bilateral vestibulopathy. Vestibular functional tests differentiate \nbetween central and peripheral lesions, quantify the damage, and guide imaging \nassessments. Platinum salts are the main agents causing cochlear ototoxicity, \nalthough their toxicity mechanisms on the vestibular system remain unclear. \nCases of vestibular ototoxicity have been described with immune checkpoint \ninhibitors. Radiotherapy and direct tumor invasion can also cause vestibular \ndamage. All vestibular alterations increase the risk of falls, particularly in \nthe elderly. A vestibular assessment by an otolaryngologist is indicated; \ntreatment usually involves vestibular rehabilitation.\nCONCLUSION: Collaboration between oncologists and otolaryngologists is crucial \nfor evaluating vestibular function during cancer treatments with potential \nototoxicity.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise du Cancer.

This review describes the current state of utDNA as a marker of \nBCa.\nMETHODS: Articles published between 2015 and 2025 on current utDNA-based \ntechniques in BCa were identified and analyzed for relevance and insight into \nutDNA research and usage.\nKEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Recent investigations underscore the \nnoninvasiveness and superior tumor detection capabilities of utDNA, particularly \nin the detection of minimal residual disease. Moreover, utDNA provides \nactionable information, such as tumor grade and staging information, to support \nprecise treatment decisions, including targeted immunotherapy regimens and \nbladder preservation strategies. Although utDNA has shown promising results in \nsmall studies, larger studies must be performed before it can be considered as a \nstandard procedure in clinical practice.\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Urinary tumor DNA has demonstrated great \npotential to improve on most, if not all, stages of detection, treatment, and \nmonitoring of BCa. By preserving the low cost and noninvasiveness of urine \ncytology, and by replacing its suboptimal accuracy with a precision rivaling and \noften exceeding cystoscopy and circulating tumor DNA-based methods, utDNA offers \npatients a more comfortable, repeatable, and accurate way of detecting BCa.

Preclinical studies have suggested that these 2 drugs \nsynergize with one another to drive anti-tumor responses. However, it remains \nunknown whether EV and pembrolizumab demonstrate synergistic activity in a \nclinical setting.\nMETHODS: We analyzed progression-free survival (PFS) from the pivotal clinical \ntrials evaluating EV and/or pembrolizumab as 1L therapy for aUC, focusing on \ncisplatin-ineligible patients. We computed predicted PFS for combination EV+P \nunder a statistical model of independent drug action. We then compared predicted \nPFS to observed PFS to ascertain whether EV+P demonstrates synergistic vs. \nindependent drug activity.\nRESULTS: Predicted PFS for EV+P combination therapy, assuming independent action \nof EV and pembrolizumab, was clinically and statistically indistinguishable from \nobserved PFS for EV+P in the EV-302 trial (HR = 1.04 [0.79-1.37], P = 0.76).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among cisplatin-ineligible patients with untreated aUC, the \nobserved clinical efficacy of combination EV+P is supported by a model of \nindependent drug action. These findings suggest that distinct patient subgroups \nrespond to EV and/or pembrolizumab. Identifying predictive biomarkers of \nresponse for each drug could reduce unnecessary toxicity arising from universal \ncombination therapy, as patients could instead be selectively treated with \nwhichever therapy is more likely to be effective.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Those receiving an ARPI had lower baseline PSA levels \n(3.4 vs 29.7\u00a0ng/ml, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and lower rates of bone (77.4% vs 87.4%, \np\u00a0=\u00a00.035) and visceral (18.9% vs 34%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) metastases. While patients on \nARPIs were more likely to complete all six cycles of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (63.2% \nvs 48.7%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), PSA50 response rates were similar (49.1% vs 47.3%, \np\u00a0=\u00a00.786). Median OS was longer with concurrent ARPI use (not reached vs \n15.3\u00a0mo, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but this difference was not significant on a multivariate \nanalysis (hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.03 [95% confidence interval: 0.68-1.55], p\u00a0=\u00a00.891) \nafter accounting for baseline differences in other prognostic variables. \nLimitations include its single-center, retrospective design and a lack of \nstandardized radiographic response assessment.\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Among men with mCRPC previously exposed \nto an ARPI, continuation of the ARPI with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 did not improve \nPSA50 response rates or OS after adjusting for cohort imbalances in known \nprognostic factors.

Liver dysfunction impacts survival and may influence treatment \nresults. About a quarter of patients with advanced HCC present with Child-Pugh B \nliver functions. All recent phase 3 trials validating standard of care limited \ninclusion to patients with Child-Pugh A liver function. Results of immunotherapy \nis less described in patients with altered liver function. We previously showed \nthat the ALBI grade might be able to better select patients with Child-Pugh B \nliver functions who could benefit from sorafenib. Single-agent anti-PD-(L)1 \nantibodies might have a more favorable safety profile than standard of care \ncombinations.\nMETHODS: We thus launched a study, the HESTIA trial, testing tislelizumab, an \nanti-PD-1 antibody that was demonstrated as non-inferior to sorafenib as \nfirst-line treatment, in the population of patients with advanced HCC, \nChild-Pugh B and ALBI grade 1 or 2 liver function.\nRESULTS: In this article, we present the design of the study and first safety \nresults. This is a single-arm phase 2 study. Fifty patients will be included. \nThe primary endpoint is objective response rate.

We aimed to assess the \neffect of adjuvant chemotherapy on overall survival in these older patients with \nhigh-risk tumours according to a prognostic genomic signature.\nMETHODS: This phase 3, randomised, superiority study was conducted at 84 \nclinical sites in France and Belgium in women aged 70 years and older with \noestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative primary breast cancer or isolated \nlocal recurrence before any systemic treatment and after complete surgery. \nGenomic grade index (GGI) testing was done with a reverse-transcriptase PCR \nassay of eight genes on paraffin-embedded tumour tissue in a central laboratory. \nPatients with a GGI high-risk tumour were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive \neither four cycles of postoperative taxane-based or anthracycline-based \nchemotherapy given every 3 weeks followed by hormonotherapy (chemotherapy group) \nor hormonotherapy alone (no chemotherapy group). Randomisation was stratified \naccording to the G8 screening tool score for geriatric frailty, nodal status, \nand centre. The primary endpoint was overall survival. This study is registered \nwith ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01564056) and is under active follow-up.\nFINDINGS: Between April 12, 2012 and April 14, 2016, 1969 patients were screened \nfor GGI, of whom 1089 had a GGI high-risk tumour and were randomly allocated to \nthe chemotherapy group (n=541) or the no chemotherapy group (n=548). Median age \nwas 75\u00b71 years (IQR 72\u00b75 to 78\u00b77) and geriatric frailty (G8 score \u226414) was \nidentified in 437 patients (40%) patients. With a median follow-up time of 7\u00b78 \nyears (95% CI 7\u00b75 to 7\u00b78), overall survival rates were 90\u00b75% (95% CI 87\u00b76 to \n92\u00b78) at 4 years and 72\u00b77% (67\u00b78 to 77\u00b70) at 8 years in the chemotherapy group, \nand 89\u00b73% (86\u00b72 to 91\u00b76) at 4 years and 68\u00b73% (63\u00b73 to 72\u00b77) at 8 years in the \nno chemotherapy group (stratified log-rank p=0\u00b72100; hazard ratio 0\u00b783 [95% CI \n0\u00b763 to 1\u00b711]), yielding statistically non-significant absolute differences in \nsurvival probability of 1\u00b73 percentage points (95% CI -2\u00b74 to 5\u00b70) at 4 years \nand 4\u00b75% (95% CI -2\u00b71 to 11\u00b71) at 8 years. Safety analysis favoured the no \nchemotherapy group: at least one grade 3 or higher adverse event occurred in 52 \n(9%) of 548 patients in the no chemotherapy group (including one death not \nrelated to treatment), compared with 183 (34%) of 541 patients in the \nchemotherapy group (including three deaths, of which one was related to \ntreatment).\nINTERPRETATION: The addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to hormonotherapy \nconferred no survival benefit in women aged 70 years and above with a GGI \nhigh-risk oestrogen receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer, and was \nassociated with more adverse events, providing important data on the \nbenefit-risk balance of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to adjuvant hormonotherapy \nin this older age group.\nFUNDING: Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique (PHRC National Cancer \n2011), Cephalon, Amgen, Ipsogen, Association d'Aide \u00e0 la Recherche \nCanc\u00e9rologique de Saint-Cloud, and Ligue Contre le Cancer.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

In this \nstudy, we have engineered a novel polymerized apoferritin carrier, utilizing \nreversible boronate ester bonds to interconnect the dihydrocaffeic acid modified \n\u03b5-polylysine (\u03b5-PLL-CAT) and 3-formylphenylboronic acid (3-FPBA) modified on the \nsurface of individual apoferritin. This carrier is further compartmentalized \nwith calcium phosphate and the calcium ion extrusion inhibitor curcumin. We have \nconfirmed that during in vivo circulation, polymerized apoferritin can \neffectively reduce the interception and interference of the nanocage by masking \nthe long unstructured loop on the surface of the apoferritin nanocage. Upon \nencountering the acidic tumor microenvironment, the reversible boronate ester \nbonds gradually degrade, triggering the progressive disassembly of the \npolymerized protein cage. This process culminates in the release of a high \nconcentration of intracellular calcium ions within tumor cells, thereby \nsignificantly enhancing the efficacy of calcium overload therapy for breast \ncancer. Moreover, these dispersed nanocages can trigger a domino effect in \nneighboring tumor cells, facilitating deep-layer delivery. This process is \nmediated by calcium ion-dependent lysosomal exocytosis and transcytosis, which \nhas been shown to be highly beneficial for inducing calcium overload. In \nsummary, the strategy presented in this study not only improves the in vivo \nbiodistribution of apoferritin nanocages for drug delivery, but also \nconsiderably broadens their potential applications in calcium overload therapy \nfor tumors.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025.

The management of urethral strictures has evolved with the \nincreasing recognition of the poor success of repetitive endoscopic treatments, \ncoinciding with mounting evidence demonstrating durable success of \nurethroplasty. These management principles were further codified in 2016 with \nthe publication of the male urethral stricture guidelines by the American \nUrologic Association. As a result of the AUA guidelines, in conjunction with \nincreasing exposure to urethral reconstruction during training and growth of \nGURS fellowships, it is expected that this paradigm shift would result in \nchanges in urethral stricture practice patterns. Currently, it is unknown to \nwhat extent these patterns have shifted over-time from a population level.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the Merative\u2122 MarketScan\u00ae \nDatabases to analyze treatment trends for urethral strictures. It focused on \nadult men with a first episode of urethral stricture between 2005 and 2022 who \nwere treated initially and subsequently using endoscopic management (EM), \nurethroplasty (UP), and perineal urethrostomy (PU). Cox proportional hazard \nmodels were used to assess the risk of UP after failed EM, adjusting for various \nfactors.\nRESULTS: We identified 65,333 men with urethral strictures. Of that 52.7%, \nunderwent intervention during enrollment. Table 1 shows patients' demographics. \n96.9% underwent initial EM, which decreased by 0.39% annually, while UP \nincreased by 0.38% (p<0.001). The rate of subsequent EM after a failed initial \nEM decreased by 0.66% annually (p<0.001), while UP after failed EM increased by \n0.62% (p<0.001). (Figure 1A, 1B). Regression analysis shows that after 2016 more \npatients proceeded to UP after failing EM (HR: 2.57, 95% CI: 2.07-3.19), as well \nas patients with prior suprapubic tube placement (HR 4.06, p<0.001). Patients \nwith a history of prostate cancer (HR 0.54, p<0.01) and coronary artery disease \n(HR 0.60, p<0.05) were less likely to undergo UP after failing EM.\nCONCLUSIONS: In a population-based dataset, the trends in urethral stricture \nmanagement are encouraging with increasing utilization of UP and decreasing use \nof EM, following failed EM after publication of the AUA guidelines.

However, targeted \nrecommendations on drug selection, dosing, duration and monitoring, are lacking. \nCurrent recommendations rely on data from other arterial diseases, often \noverlooking SBS-related drug absorption issues. To understand current practices, \nthis survey aimed to assess the long-term antithrombotic therapy practices in \nAMI.\nMETHODS: An e-survey was disseminated to HAN-CIF (Home Artificial Nutrition - \nChronic Intestinal Failure) database centers of ESPEN (European Society on \nClinical nutrition and Metabolism) and coagulation specialists. It included ten \ncases with varying postsurgical intestinal anatomy, revascularisation and \naetiology. Questions focused on drug class choice, administration route, dosing, \nduration and monitoring of antithrombotic therapy.\nRESULTS: For patients with AMI of unknown aetiology, but with \nhypercholesterolaemia and smoking status, intestinal failure (IF) teams \npreferred anticoagulants (55.8-65.1%) over antiplatelet therapy (27.9-37.2%), \nwhile coagulation specialists favoured antiplatelet therapy (57.1%). IF teams \nselected antiplatelet therapy more often in patients with type 3 anatomy \n(largest absorptive capacity). They favoured parenteral agents for patients with \nend-jejunostomy or duodenocolic anastomosis (51.2% and 55.8% respectively; \nlowest absorptive capacity), oral agents for those without IF (69.8%; highest \nabsorptive capacity), and both for patients with a jejunocolic anastomosis \n(48.8% oral, 44.2% parenteral; moderate absorptive capacity). Coagulation \nspecialists consistently preferred oral therapy. Lifelong antiplatelet therapy \nwas preferred by IF teams (71.4-100.0%), while anticoagulants were prescribed \neither temporarily (16.7-59.1%) or lifelong (40.9-83.3%). Standard doses were \nused for all drug classes, irrespective of anatomy, revascularisation or \ncomorbidities. Monitoring varied: IF teams monitored subcutaneous low molecular \nweight heparins and non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (DOACs), whereas \ncoagulation specialists only monitored DOACs. Both specialists commonly \nperformed a 24-hour Holter, transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiograms \nfor arterial mesenteric ischaemia (MI) and requested thrombophilia parameters \nmore for venous MI, with antiphospholipid antibodies checked for both MI \nsubtypes.\nCONCLUSION: We observed significant variation in long-term antithrombotic \nmanagement in post-AMI SBS patients, with differing approaches between IF and \ncoagulation specialists.

Gremlin 1 (GREM1), a member of the \nbone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist family, has emerged as a central \nregulator of cellular and extracellular dynamics, exhibiting dual roles in \noncogenesis and fibrosis. By modulating BMP and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways, GREM1 \norchestrates critical pathogenic processes, including immune evasion, stromal \ndynamics, fibroblast activation, and angiogenesis. This review compiles current \nmechanistic insights into GREM1's dual roles in cancer and fibrosis, \nhighlighting its potential as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target. GREM1 \ncontributes to tumor progression by promoting an immunosuppressive tumor \nmicroenvironment (TME) and therapy resistance while driving extracellular matrix \ndeposition and tissue remodeling in fibrotic disorders. Emerging therapeutic \nstrategies, including demethyleneberberine (DMB), anti-GREM1 antibodies, and \ncircular RNAs, demonstrate potential in mitigating GREM1-driven pathological \nprocesses. GREM1's pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cancer and fibrosis \nhighlights its promise as a target for innovative combination therapies and \nbiomarker-based precision medicine approaches.

A critical challenge remains as strategies are \nneeded to precisely target the diverse molecular drivers of leukemia stem cells \n(LSCs), particularly in the context of their protective microenvironment, to \nachieve optimal therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we investigated the role of \naldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) in chemotherapy resistance in patients with \nrelapsed/refractory AML and demonstrated that elevated ALDH2 expression in LSCs \nis closely associated with AML relapse and treatment resistance. \nMechanistically, ALDH2 sustains mitochondrial homeostasis in LSCs by increasing \nthe expression of protein kinase C delta (PKC delta) and serine \nhydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), revealing a previously unidentified \nmechanism of metabolic reprogramming that facilitates LSC adaptation to \nchemotherapy-induced stress. The ALDH2\u2012PKC delta-SHMT2 axis plays a pivotal role \nin conferring resistance to chemotherapy in LSCs. Notably, rhoifolin, a compound \ndesigned to inhibit the specific binding site of ALDH2-PKC delta, significantly \nincreased chemosensitivity. It could target LSCs within the bone marrow \nmicroenvironment, work synergistically with conventional chemotherapy drugs, and \nexhibit no toxicity toward normal cells.

Stratification is based on risk group (intermediate vs \nhigh) and nodal status (pN0 vs pNx).\nRESULTS: From March 2023 to November 2024, 122 patients have been enrolled: 34 \n(28%) with intermediate risk and 88 (72%) with high risk. Fifty-five patients \n(45%) are pNx. The mean time from surgery to BCR is 25.4 months, and the PSA at \ninclusion was 0.55\u2009ng/ml. Restaging was performed in 89 patients, 75 of whom \nunderwent PET/CT (97%, PSMA PET/CT). Hypofractionation was used in 68% of cases, \nand elective pelvic irradiation in 33%. At the time of analysis, all patients \nhad PSA normalization. No severe ADT-related toxicity has been reported \nCONCLUSION: URONCOR 06-24 is the first clinical trial comparing long- versus \nshort-term ADT in the setting of BCR after prostatectomy, with stratification by \nrisk group.

Sericin was isolated by the degumming process followed by the \ncharacterization by using FTIR, UV, XRD, and SEM techniques to confirm the \nsuccessful synthesis of SAgNPs and SChiAgNPs. The male Balb C mice were then \ndivided into 13 groups. Group 1: Control, Group 2: DMH (20\u202fmg/kg) (injected (IP) \nthrice a week for 14\u202fweeks).

Groups 6,7,8,9 were considered as preventive groups and were given \nDMH (IP)\u202f+\u202f5-FU (IP), DMH(IP)\u202f+\u202fS (orally), DMH (IP)\u202f+\u202fSAgNPs (orally), DMH \n(IP)\u202f+\u202fSChiAgNPs (orally) respectively for the period of 14\u202fweeks Groups \n10,11,12,13 were considered as treatment groups and were given 5-FU (5\u202fmg/kg) \n(IP), (S) (100\u202fmg/kg) (orally), (SAgNPs) (100\u202fmg/kg) (orally), (SChiAgNPs) \n(100\u202fmg/kg) (orally) for a period of first 7\u202fweeks after 7\u202fweeks of DMH \nadministration (IP). After 14\u202fweeks period study, blood samples and colon tissue \nwere used for the analysis of biochemical markers i.e., CEA, CA19-9, TIMP-1, and \nIL-6, IL-8, IL-27, SOD, CAT, GR, GSH, GST, MDA and MMP-7 via ELISA and \nhistopathological analysis. The UV absorption peaks obtained at 435 and 463\u202fnm \nindicated the formation of SAgNPs and SChiAgNPs formation respectively. FTIR \nspectra peaks obtained, indicate NH stretching of primary and secondary amine \ngroup), (NH stretching of amine salt) (N=C=S stretching of thiocyanate \ncompound), (CC stretching of alkene), (NO stretching of nitro compound), (SO \nstretching of sulfonyl chloride), (CN stretching of amine) and (C-O-O \nstretching) for sericin, SAgNPs, and SChiAgNPs, confirming, the presence of \ntheses functional groups. The XRD pattern revealed that SAgNPs and SChiAgNPs had \nstructure crystalline structures. EDX characterization peaks for SAgNPs \nindicated the presence of silver along with other elements including; calcium, \noxygen carbon, while EDX characterization peaks for SChiAgNPs indicated the \npresence of silver along with other elements including; oxygen, carbon, sodium, \nphosphorus, Sulphur and chlorine. SEM analysis showed that SAgNPs are of \nspherical shape, while the SChiAgNPs displayed the rectangular shape.

In \ncontrast, levels of SOD, GR, GSH, CAT and GST were reduced significantly in DMH \ntreated group, which were increased significantly in SChiAg(T) (p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001). The \nhistopathological analysis of proximal and distal parts of colon tissue of the \nDMH-treated group showed low-grade dysplasia (LGD), and high-grade dysplasia \n(HGD) while SChiAgNPs improved the histopathological changes induced by DMH.

Previously, we developed a liposomal \nformulation of copper diethyldithiocarbamate (Cu(DDC)2) by incorporating DDC \ninto copper-containing liposomes. In this study, we present an improved \nformulation achieved by directly mixing DDC and copper in a suspension of empty \nliposomes, leveraging DDC's copper ionophore-like activity. This method \nminimizes Cu(DDC)2 precipitation outside the liposomes and enables efficient \ndrug loading at defined molar ratios. The formulation effectively slowed the \ngrowth of subcutaneous MDA-MB-231 tumors in mice and showed increased efficacy \nin 4T1 tumors in immunocompetent mice compared to immunocompromised \ncounterparts. In vitro, Cu(DDC)2-treated cancer cells exhibited upregulation of \ndamage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including ATP release, HMGB1 \nsecretion, and calreticulin exposure. Transcriptomic analysis revealed increased \nexpression of immune activation and copper transport genes, further supporting \nthe potential for immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction. In a prophylactic \ntumor vaccination model, inoculation with Cu(DDC)2-treated CT26 cells delayed \ntumor growth and conferred protection in a subset of animals, indicating the \ninduction of an adaptive immune response consistent with ICD. These findings \nalign with previous reports of disulfiram-induced ICD and provide functional \nvalidation linking this activity to DDC's role as a copper ionophore.

However, despite these therapies being able to \ninduce remission in a proportion of patients, many lung cancer patients \nexperience tumor recurrence. To combat high relapse rates, the adoptive transfer \nof natural killer (NK) cells as NSCLC immunotherapy is attractive as these cells \ndo not require antigen presentation, do not induce GvHD, and can be active in \nallogeneic settings. However, NSCLC response rates remain low because of the \ndevelopment of resistance mechanisms to NK cell attack. Much of the resistance \nstems from metabolic reprogramming occurring in the lung cancer tumor \nmicroenvironment, owing to aggressive metabolic activity of cancer cells \nresulting in the production of immunosuppressive metabolites and metabolic \nbyproducts, including oncometabolites. Immune evasion via MHC loss and malignant \ntransformation toward an immunosuppressive niche alters NK cell chemotaxis, \nreduces their recruitment and impairs their activation. Here, we discuss NSCLC \npathophysiology, the immune crosstalk in the NSCLC TME, as well as how the TME, \nparticularly oncometabolite-mediated immunosuppression, metabolic reprogramming \nand immune dysfunction regulates therapeutic responses and NK cell functional \nalterations in NSCLC to ultimately drives response resistance.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025.

Chemotherapy alone yields a median \nsurvival of 10-11 months and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of <5%. \nConcurrent re-irradiation and chemotherapy constitutes an alternative, \nnon-standard strategy. Herein, we report the long-term outcomes of NRG Oncology \nRTOG 9911, a phase II trial of split course radiation (RT) and concurrent \npaclitaxel and cisplatin.\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligibility stipulated measurable, recurrent SCCHN or SPT \nin previously irradiated fields, PS 0-1, and adequate end-organ indices. \nPatients received split course, twice-daily RT (1.5 Gy/fraction BID x 5d every 2 \nweeks x4), plus cisplatin (15 mg/m2 QD x 5) and paclitaxel (20 mg/m2 QD x5) \nevery 2 weeks for four cycles. G-CSF was administered days 6-13 of each 2-week \ncycle. Primary endpoint was OS relative to historical control, NRG Oncology RTOG \n9610. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), toxicities, \nand patterns of failure.\nRESULTS: Between March, 2000 and June, 2003, 105 patients were enrolled; 100 \npatients were analyzable (76% male, median age 60 years). Oropharynx (41%) and \noral cavity (27%) were the predominant primary sites. 23% had SPT. Median prior \nRT dose was 65.7 Gy. 73% of patients completed all chemotherapy. 9 \ntreatment-related deaths (9%) occurred: 5 in the acute and 4 in the late \nsetting. Survival was significantly improved over historical control (p=0.01) \nwith 5-year survival increased from 3.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0, 8.0) \nto 14.9% (95% CI 7.9, 21.9). Five-year PFS was 7.0% (95% CI 2.0, 12.0). 64.9% \ndied from the incident cancer, 3.2% from SPT, and 22.3% from non-cancer or \nunknown causes. In 1-year survivors, the rate of subsequent late grade 4-5 \ntoxicity was significantly higher than historical control (p=0.02), with 5-year \ncumulative incidence of 22.4% (95% CI 11.8, 35.1) compared with 3.2% (95% CI \n0.2, 14.5).\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite a high incidence of grade 5 toxicity, OS rates for this \ntrial evaluating concurrent split course BID re-irradiation with cisplatin and \npaclitaxel exceeded results seen historically with chemotherapy alone.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

We aimed to externally validate dose patterns and \ndosimetric predictors of grade \u2265 2 RE (RE2+) in an independent NSCLC cohort.\nMATERIALS/METHODS: We analyzed RTOG-0617 trial patient data. Patients received \nconcurrent chemotherapy with or without cetuximab, and 60- versus 74-Gy \nradiation doses. Voxel-Based Analysis (VBA) assessed spatial dose differences \nbetween patients with and without RE2+. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) \nincluded dose maps and each non-dosimetric variables selected by a LASSO \nregularized GLM of RE2+. A non-parametric permutation test of the maximum \nthreshold-free cluster-enhanced statistic accounting for multiple comparisons \nwas performed, the significance p- maps generated and compared using \nDice-over-volume metric (DIV) with previous VBA results. External validity of \nesophageal predictors was also assessed in terms of discrimination (ROC-AUC) and \ncalibration.\nRESULTS: Among 495 patients, 326 patients met inclusion criteria for analysis. \nThe RE2+ incidence (44%) was consistent with the development cohort. Clinical \nfactors were not significantly correlated with RE2+. VBA identified the most \nsignificant regions of associations between BED and RE2+ in the Upper and Middle \nthoracic Esophageal (UME) segment, with satisfactory overlap with a prior study \n(DIV\u202f=\u202f0.7). The relative esophageal volume receiving \u2265 55 Gy (V55Gy) and the \nUME mean dose (Dmean) were both confirmed as good predictors in external \nvalidation with comparable discrimination (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.7, 95% CI: [0.61, 0.72]). \nCalibration curves indicated superior risk prediction accuracy for UME-Dmean \n(Radj2\u202f=\u202f0.80 vs. 0.65).\nCONCLUSION: We successfully validated VBA findings on RE in an independent NSCLC \ncohort, reinforcing the role of the upper-middle esophagus as a critical region \nfor RE2+ risk.

Study bias \nwas assessed with the Cochrane ROB.2. A Bayesian random-effects network \nmeta-analysis was conducted for indirect comparisons, with \u03c4\u00b2 used to evaluate \nheterogeneity. Treatment rankings were generated using the SUCRA curve, and \nevidence certainty was assessed with the CINeMA framework. Nineteen RCTs with a \ntotal of 2,937 patients met the inclusion criteria. In our network \nmeta-analysis, CCRT+CT showed the most significant benefit for OS (HR 0.46, 95% \nCI 0.28-0.71, SUCRA 95%, high-certainty evidence), followed by SCRT (1.59, \n1.04-2.33, 65%, high-certainty evidence) and CCRT alone (0.71, 0.5-0.95, 48%, \nmoderate-certainty evidence). For DFS, CCRT+CT again showed a significant \nadvantage over RT (0.48, 0.23-0.91, 88%, low-certainty evidence). In recurrence \nanalysis, CCRT+CT demonstrated the most substantial reduction in recurrence risk \n(RR 0.45, 0.15-0.83, 85%), followed by CCRT (0.59, 0.24-0.97, 68%) and SCRT \n(1.17, 1.01-3.28, 40%). No statistically significant differences were observed \nfor distant recurrence or metastasis among the therapies; however, SUCRA \nrankings indicated that CCRT+CT and CCRT might offer some benefit in reducing \nthese outcomes. For adverse events-specifically myelosuppression, proctitis, \ncystitis, and nausea/vomiting-no significant differences in risk were observed \nacross therapies. However, SUCRA rankings favored RT as the most favorable \noption for minimizing these events. This study provides a comprehensive \nassessment of postoperative adjuvant therapies for early-stage cervical cancer. \nAmong the evaluated options, CCRT+CT showed the most promising trend toward \nimproving overall and disease-free survival and reducing recurrence, \nparticularly in patients with high-risk features.

Healthy individuals \nunderwent the same assessments, including peripheral and respiratory muscle \nstrength, functional exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance (6MWD), 1-minute \nsit-to-stand (1MSTS)), objectively measured physical activity (PA), and \npatient-reported outcomes on symptoms and HRQoL.\nRESULTS: Seventy-six patients (66\u00b19 years; 65% male) and 46 healthy individuals \n(64\u00b110 years; 59% male) were included. At diagnosis, patients scored \nsignificantly worse than healthy individuals across most outcomes. Twelve weeks, \npost-surgery (n=41), patients showed significant worsening of 1MSTS (-2\u00b14 reps, \np=0.03), 6MWD (-24\u00b159 m, p=0.008), self-efficacy for PA, dyspnea, physical \nwellbeing, and lung cancer-specific symptoms (p<0.05). Declines were more \npronounced with (neo-)adjuvant therapy. Systemic chemotherapy (n=16) worsened \nself-efficacy to perform PA (p=0.03), while radiotherapy (n=5) reduced \nself-reported PA (p<0.05) and increased fatigue (p=0.04), but improved mental \nwellbeing (p=0.03). All treatment groups showed significantly lower PA \npost-treatment compared to healthy individuals.\nCONCLUSION: At diagnosis, patients with NSCLC had worse physical functioning, \nsymptoms, and HRQoL than healthy individuals. Treatment for NSCLC further \ndeteriorated these outcomes, with patients exhibiting significantly lower \nphysical activity compared to healthy individuals.

Among the key \ncontributors to this resistance are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which \nare increasingly recognized for their tumor-supportive roles. Despite this, the \nmolecular pathways through which CAFs promote chemoresistance in LUSC are not \nfully elucidated. This study found that CAFs-derived interleukin-6 (IL-6) \nupregulated the expression of Specificity Protein 1 (SP1) and the ATP-binding \ncassette transporter B7 (ABCB7) in LUSC cells exposed to cisplatin and \ndocetaxel. In vitro assays showed a marked decrease in apoptosis in tumor cells \nco-cultured with CAFs. Consistent with these findings, in vivo xenograft models \ndemonstrated that IL-6-producing CAFs reduced the antitumor efficacy of both \nchemotherapeutic agents. Elevated serum IL-6 levels also emerged as a potential \nindicator of poor response to chemotherapy. Our findings suggest that IL-6 \nsecreted by CAFs impairs the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and docetaxel in \nLUSC, partly through activation of the PI3K/AKT/NF-\u03baB signaling axis.

Propensity-matched comparisons were performed between del(1p) patients and \na control group without del(1p) and with standard-risk cytogenetics.\nRESULTS: 55 patients were included in our analysis. With a median follow-up of \n24.0 months (range 3.8-79.5), the median PFS was 30.2 months (95% CI 18.0-not \nreached [NR]) and median OS was not reached (95% CI 41.1-NR). In multivariable \nanalysis, female patients (hazard ratio [95% CI] 2.81 [1.14, 6.91], p=0.025) and \nthose with R2-ISS stage IV (compared with stage II 4.85 [1.01, 23.34], p=0.049) \nhad worse PFS, whereas patients who achieved CR as best post-transplant response \nhad better PFS (0.38 [0.16, 0.91], p=0.029). Concomitant del(17p) was associated \nwith a significantly worse OS (4.47 [1.18, 17.02], p=0.028). Propensity score \nmatching showed no significant differences in PFS (1.63 [0.86, 3.10], p=0.13) or \nOS (1.77 [0.73, 4.32], p=0.21) between del(1p) and control patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: In NDMM patients undergoing upfront autoHCT, del(1p) alone was not \nsignificantly associated with inferior outcomes.

CRS and bacteremia share clinical features, \nmaking it difficult to distinguish between the two and deliver targeted \ntreatment. As a result, most patients with CRS receive empiric broad-spectrum \nantibiotics that may adversely impact long-term outcomes.\nOBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to identify blood biomarkers that \ndistinguish between CRS and bacteremia in the first month after CAR-T. We also \ndescribe the utilization of empiric antibiotics to identify opportunities for \nimproved antimicrobial stewardship.\nSTUDY DESIGN: We identified patients who received CAR-T for hematologic \nmalignancies between July 2013 and April 2024. We calculated the cumulative \nincidences of CRS and bacteremia within 30 days post-CAR-T. In a matched case \ncontrol analysis, where three patients with CRS and no bacteremia (controls) \nwere matched to each patient with bacteremia (cases), we described the clinical \ncharacteristics of CRS, bacteremia, and antibiotic exposure. We then assessed \nthe levels and kinetics of six biomarkers (C-reactive protein [CRP], \ninterleukin-6, ferritin, fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer) for \ntheir ability to discriminate between bacteremia and CRS using Mann-Whitney U \ntests and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models.\nRESULTS: Among 694 CAR-T recipients, 517 (75%; 95% confidence interval [CI], \n71-78%) developed CRS. Bacteremia occurred in 19 patients with a cumulative \nincidence of 2.7% (95% CI, 1.7-4.2%) within 30 days and 1.4% (95% CI, 0.7-2.6%) \nwithin 14 days of CAR-T. The median time from blood culture to positive result \nwas one day (interquartile range [IQR], 1-1). Among the 57 matched controls, CRS \noccurred a median of four days (IQR, 1-5) post-CAR-T, all were hospitalized for \nfevers, and 92% of CRS events were treated with empiric antibiotics for a median \nof seven days (IQR, 5-8). As a result, for every patient with bacteremia treated \nwith antibiotics within the first 14 days, an estimated 52 patients with CRS and \nno serious bacterial infection received empiric antibiotics. The levels and \nkinetics of biomarkers were similar among cases and controls within 14 days \nafter CAR-T. Beyond day +14, CRP, D-dimer, and ferritin levels were \nsignificantly higher among patients with bacteremia and distinguished cases from \ncontrols with moderate discrimination (area under the curve of 0.77, 0.77, and \n0.81, respectively). In addition, increasing CRP and fibrinogen \u2265 14 days \npost-CAR-T were significantly associated with bacteremia (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; \n95% CI, 1.07-2.01 and OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.28-14.61 per 0.25 log10 increase in \nbiomarker level per day, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: We demonstrate that most CAR-T recipients who developed CRS received \nempiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, but bacteremia was rare. Although blood \nbiomarkers were unable to distinguish between CRS and bacteremia early after \nCAR-T, higher CRP, D-dimer, and ferritin and rising levels of CRP and fibrinogen \n\u226514 days post-CAR-T were associated with bacteremia and can facilitate earlier \ntargeted interventions. These data highlight opportunities for improved \nantibiotic stewardship in the context of CRS, which is critical given the \nassociation between broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, gut microbiome \ndysbiosis, and worse outcomes after CAR-T.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025.

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a centralised, \nweb-based system using minimisation with a random component to either \nenzalutamide 160 mg daily (oral) or enzalutamide 160 mg daily plus \nadaptive-dosed (two or four doses) intravenous [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 7\u00b75 GBq every \n6-8 weeks. The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) \nprogression-free survival, which has been reported previously. All participants \nunderwent baseline [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT to assess eligibility (SUVmax >15 at \na single site and SUVmax >10 at all larger tumour sites). PSMA-PET parameters \nwere quantified with semi-automated software to derive PSMA-TTV and SUVmean and \ncorrelated with overall and PSA progression-free survival in a prespecified \nanalysis, with the primary endpoint of this substudy being overall survival. \nThresholds were based on SUVmean highest quartile (Q4 vs Q1-3) and PSMA-TTV \nmedian at baseline. We used the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models \nand analysed patients on a treatment received basis. The trial is registered \nwith ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04419402, and follow-up is complete.\nFINDINGS: Between Aug 17, 2020, and July 26, 2022, 162 participants were \nrandomly assigned to enzalutamide (n=79) or enzalutamide plus [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 \n(n=83). This substudy included the 160 of the 162 randomly assigned patients who \nreceived study treatment (79 in the enzalutamide group and 81 in the \nenzalutamide plus [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group). Median follow-up at the final data \ncutoff (July 31, 2024) was 34 months (IQR 29-39), with 96 overall survival \nevents (53 with enzalutamide and 43 with enzalutamide plus [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617). \nBaseline median SUVmean was 7\u00b77 (IQR 6\u00b75-9\u00b78) and median PSMA-TTV was 234 mL \n(76-687). Median overall survival for PSMA-TTV below or above the median in the \nenzalutamide group was 39 months (95% CI 31-not estimable) versus 20 months \n(13-24; HR 0\u00b723 [95% CI 0\u00b713-0\u00b742], log-rank p<0\u00b70001). The corresponding median \noverall survival for PSMA-TTV below or above the median in the enzalutamide plus \n[177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group was 35 months (95% CI 32-37) versus 28 months (26-34; \nHR 0\u00b766 [0\u00b736-1\u00b721], log-rank p=0\u00b718). The test for interaction between PSMA-TTV \nand treatment group for overall survival was p=0\u00b70078. Median overall survival \nfor SUVmean Q4 versus Q1-3 in the enzalutamide group was 29 months (95% CI \n17-39) versus 25 months (21-31; HR 0\u00b784 [0\u00b744-1\u00b760], log-rank p=0\u00b759). For \nenzalutamide plus [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, median overall survival for SUVmean Q4 \nversus Q1-3 was 32 months (95% CI 21-not estimable) versus 34 months (27-35; HR \n0\u00b780 [0\u00b738-1\u00b768], log-rank p=0\u00b756). The test for interaction between SUVmean (Q4 \nvs Q1-3) and treatment group for overall survival was p=0\u00b788.\nINTERPRETATION: Baseline PSMA-TTV is prognostic for overall survival and \npredictive for a beneficial effect on overall survival with the addition of \n[177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 to enzalutamide as first-line treatment for high-risk \nmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. By contrast, PSMA SUVmean was \nnot prognostic for PSA progression-free survival or overall survival when \n[177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 was administered with enzalutamide.\nFUNDING: The Prostate Cancer Research Alliance initiative (Movember and \nAustralian Federal Government), Prostate Cancer Foundation Challenge Award, St \nVincent's Clinic Foundation, GenesisCare, RoyMorgan, Endocyte (a Novartis \ncompany), and Astellas.", "Copyright \u00a9 2025 Elsevier Ltd.
